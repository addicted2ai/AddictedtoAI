# review — delta for make-the-blog-worth-sending

One requirement is modified: the blog-post checklist grows to verify the
form, the anchor, and the affected party, and directs the post's
`would-cite` record at the send question. The field's mechanics — required,
non-empty, non-duplicated, refused by the merge otherwise — are deliberately
untouched: the one mechanism that makes the quality question *asked* is
reused, not duplicated. Every other checklist and every other requirement is
restated unchanged.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: What is checked depends on what the work is

The reviewer SHALL work from the checklist for the job's kind — reviewing a
wiki entry, a tutorial, and a machinery change are not the same job:

- **Wiki entry**: every cited fact has a reachable source and the source
  says what the fact says (fetch and confirm — do not assume); volatile
  values are transclusions or feed-bound, not literals; aliases sanely
  classed; prose adds something beyond the data.
- **Tutorial**: evidence the steps were actually executed (transcript or
  reproduced outputs) — plausibility is not verification; `subjects`,
  `verified_against`, `verified_on` complete and honest; unexecuted steps
  disclosed; perishables all declared.
- **Blog post**: every external claim source-checked by fetching; title and
  excerpt read against the body for overclaim; company-conduct claims held
  to the news-fact-checking standard; dates explicit. Additionally, the
  reviewer SHALL identify the post's form (news note or synthesis — see
  `blog`) and apply that form's finish line: for a note, the declared
  anchor holds (external anchors fetched and confirmed to document the
  event and its date), the affected party is named where one exists, and
  brevity alone is never a defect; for a synthesis, the derivation method
  is stated and the evidence enumerable. For a post, the record's
  `would-cite` field SHALL answer the send question — who would send this,
  and to whom — in the reviewer's own words; the field's mechanics are
  unchanged.
- **Education page**: no perishable literals; prerequisites and the
  "after this you will understand" statement honest; beats the obvious
  alternative.
- **Directory/curated data**: spot-check changed rows against their sources.
- **Machinery change**: run the changed check or script and confirm the
  claimed behavior — red before, green after where applicable; every claim
  about what the change does verified by executing, not by reading; guard
  rails tested by attempting what they forbid.

For a job that originated from a proposal, the checklist additionally
includes the rejection index (`data/proposals/rejected/`): the reviewer
confirms the piece is not a differently-worded re-tread of a rejected
proposal — this is the judgment half of duplicate suppression, whose
mechanical half is the exact slug match in `loop`.

In every kind, the reviewer's standing instruction is: **for every claim
about what something does, run the cheap direct check; for every sourced
claim, confirm the source supports it.** The defect class this review exists
to catch is the claim written from intent rather than measurement — found
repeatedly by skeptical readers on the previous site and never once by an
automated check.

#### Scenario: The reviewer measures instead of reading

- **WHEN** a machinery diff claims "this makes X impossible"
- **THEN** the reviewer attempts X against the changed code and the verdict
  cites the attempt's observed result, not the diff's description

#### Scenario: A post review answers the send question

- **WHEN** a reviewer approves a news note
- **THEN** the record's `would-cite` field says who would send the note and
  to whom, in the reviewer's own words, and the merge's existing non-empty
  and non-duplicate checks apply to it unchanged
