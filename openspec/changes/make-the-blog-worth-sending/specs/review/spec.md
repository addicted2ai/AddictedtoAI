# review — delta for make-the-blog-worth-sending

Two requirements are modified. The closed reason list gains
`reads-as-generated`, and post verdicts gain a second forced-judgment field
(`reads-human`) with exactly the mechanics `would-cite` already has — the
one mechanism this repository trusts for making a judgment question
*asked*. The checklist requirement's blog-post entry grows to verify the
form, the anchor, the affected party and the voice, and a `scout` entry is
added for the new job type. Everything else in both requirements is
restated unchanged. Nothing here routes to a person: the reviewer is a
model-run Desk invocation, constrained by fresh context, no edit rights,
the closed reason list, and the required own-words fields.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The reviewer judges quality with full standing, from a named reason list

The reviewer SHALL return exactly one verdict — `approve`, `revise` (with
the required changes named), or `reject` — with one or more reasons from
this closed list:

- `false-or-unsupported-claim` — a claim the cited source does not support,
  or no source where one is required;
- `intent-not-measurement` — a claim written from what something was meant
  to do rather than a measurement of what it does;
- `not-worth-reading` — dull, derivative, padded, or otherwise not worth a
  reader's time (see `editorial`). **This is a complete rejection reason in
  its own right and never needs to be dressed up as a factual defect.**
- `reads-as-generated` — the prose reads machine-made: uniform rhythm and
  paragraph shape, structure signposted rather than felt, meta-commentary
  narrating its own method, no willingness to be blunt (see `blog` and the
  voice document it names). A complete reason in its own right, for the
  half of the voice bar no lint can measure;
- `overclaiming-summary` — title/excerpt claims more than the body proves;
- `spec-violation` — violates a named requirement in these specs;
- `broken-reference` — a transclusion, mention, or link that does not hold;
- `scope-violation` — the diff exceeds the job's stated outcome or touches
  paths it should not.

Verdicts are categorical, never numeric — scores drift and become targets.

**The quality question is asked, not merely available.** For every verdict
on a prose piece, the review record SHALL contain a required, non-empty
`would-cite` field: the reviewer's own-words answer to "who would link
this, and in what argument?" An `approve` whose `would-cite` field is
empty, or exactly identical (after whitespace trimming) to the
`would-cite` field of any existing review record, is not a valid verdict
and the merge SHALL refuse it. Both checks are exact and mechanical; a
reviewer writing a fresh-but-vacuous sentence each time passes them, which
is accepted — no mechanical check can compel judgment, and the field's job
is to make the question asked. Making the quality objection sayable fixed the
old failure; this field makes it asked — a reviewer that approves
everything without ever confronting the would-cite test produces the same
unread site as one that could not object at all.

**For a blog post, the voice question is asked the same way.** A verdict
on a `post` SHALL additionally contain a required, non-empty `reads-human`
field: the reviewer's own-words answer to "where does this read
machine-made, or why does it not?" The merge SHALL refuse a post verdict
whose `reads-human` field is empty or exactly duplicates an existing
record's, on the same terms and at the same point it refuses a blank
`would-cite`. Same mechanics, same honesty about their limit: the field
compels the asking, not the judgment.

#### Scenario: An approve must answer the quality question

- **WHEN** a reviewer returns `approve` on a blog post with the
  `would-cite` field blank
- **THEN** the verdict is invalid, the merge refuses, and the reviewer must
  re-issue the verdict with the field answered

#### Scenario: Boring is a verdict

- **WHEN** a factually clean draft is judged not worth a reader's time
- **THEN** the reviewer rejects with `not-worth-reading` and the recorded
  reason says so plainly, with no manufactured factual objection

#### Scenario: A post verdict answers the voice question

- **WHEN** a reviewer returns `approve` on a post with the `reads-human`
  field blank
- **THEN** the merge refuses the verdict exactly as it would a blank
  `would-cite`, and the reviewer must re-issue it with the field answered

### Requirement: What is checked depends on what the work is

The reviewer SHALL work from the checklist for the job's kind — reviewing a
wiki entry, a tutorial, and a machinery change are not the same job:

- **Wiki entry**: every cited fact has a reachable source and the source
  says what the fact says (fetch and confirm — do not assume); volatile
  values are transclusions or feed-bound, not literals; aliases sanely
  classed; prose adds something beyond the data.
- **Tutorial**: evidence the steps were actually executed (transcript or
  reproduced outputs) — plausibility is not verification; `subjects`,
  `verified_against`, `verified_on` complete and honest; unexecuted steps
  disclosed; perishables all declared.
- **Blog post**: every external claim source-checked by fetching; title and
  excerpt read against the body for overclaim; company-conduct claims held
  to the news-fact-checking standard; dates explicit. Additionally, the
  reviewer SHALL identify the post's form (news note or synthesis — see
  `blog`) and apply that form's finish line: for a note, the declared
  anchor holds (external anchors fetched and confirmed to document the
  event and its date), the affected party is named where one exists, and
  brevity alone is never a defect; for a synthesis, the derivation method
  is stated and the evidence enumerable. The reviewer SHALL judge the
  prose against the voice document `blog` names, rejecting
  `reads-as-generated` where it reads machine-made, and SHALL answer the
  send question in the record's `would-cite` field — who would send this,
  and to whom — in its own words.
- **Scout run**: the charge's failure condition applied first — a run
  whose candidates could all have been written without leaving the
  repository fails it; evidence URLs spot-checked by fetching; every
  candidate carries slug, type, `expires:`, why-now, retrieval-dated
  evidence, and done-when lines; every declined story has a drop record
  naming the failed test and a refile condition; at most three candidates
  filed.
- **Education page**: no perishable literals; prerequisites and the
  "after this you will understand" statement honest; beats the obvious
  alternative.
- **Directory/curated data**: spot-check changed rows against their sources.
- **Machinery change**: run the changed check or script and confirm the
  claimed behavior — red before, green after where applicable; every claim
  about what the change does verified by executing, not by reading; guard
  rails tested by attempting what they forbid.

For a job that originated from a proposal, the checklist additionally
includes the rejection index (`data/proposals/rejected/`): the reviewer
confirms the piece is not a differently-worded re-tread of a rejected
proposal — this is the judgment half of duplicate suppression, whose
mechanical half is the exact slug match in `loop`.

In every kind, the reviewer's standing instruction is: **for every claim
about what something does, run the cheap direct check; for every sourced
claim, confirm the source supports it.** The defect class this review exists
to catch is the claim written from intent rather than measurement — found
repeatedly by skeptical readers on the previous site and never once by an
automated check.

#### Scenario: The reviewer measures instead of reading

- **WHEN** a machinery diff claims "this makes X impossible"
- **THEN** the reviewer attempts X against the changed code and the verdict
  cites the attempt's observed result, not the diff's description

#### Scenario: A scout run is checked against its charge

- **WHEN** a scout run's diff arrives for review with three candidates and
  two drop records
- **THEN** the reviewer verifies the candidates carry externally retrieved,
  retrieval-dated evidence, spot-fetches it, and rejects the run as
  `spec-violation` if everything filed could have been written from the
  repository alone
