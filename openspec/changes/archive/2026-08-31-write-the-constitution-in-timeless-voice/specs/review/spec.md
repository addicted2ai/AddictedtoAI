# review — delta for write-the-constitution-in-timeless-voice

Two requirements, prose only, one sentence each. Every SHALL is reproduced
byte-for-byte; every scenario is reproduced byte-for-byte.

**1. *A review record names the bytes it reviewed*.** The closing paragraph read
*"A record with no `reviewed:` key is not invalid — every record written before
this change is one."* The fact is durable and worth keeping; the way it dated
itself is not, because a reader who finds it later cannot tell which change is
meant and therefore cannot tell which records are covered. Restated against the
mechanism instead of the change: records written before the merge began writing
the key. That is the same set, and it is a boundary the reader can actually
locate — it is the merge step this very requirement defines.

**2. *Missing, unbound, and mismatched are three findings, not one*.** The
**Unbound** bullet justified never failing on unbound records by saying
*"failing on it would mean this change cannot land"* — an argument about a
merge, not about the system, and unreadable once the merge is history. The
durable reason is the one underneath it and it is stronger: every record
predating the binding mechanism is unbound, so failing on unbound would refuse
the entire corpus of records that predate it. Restated that way. The bullet's
second clause and the sentence that follows are unchanged, including the number
to watch.

Neither edit changes what is checked, what fails, or what is reported.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A review record names the bytes it reviewed

A verdict record today names a *piece*; it does not name the *text* it judged.
The join in `lib/reviews.mjs` matches a record to a piece by the canonical
URL-derived filename, three accepted alternates, or a front-matter subject key,
and the merge gate then checks that the record carries a verdict from the closed
list and a non-empty, non-duplicated `would-cite`. Every one of those checks
passes unchanged after the reviewed text is edited. An approval therefore
survives the thing it approved.

Binding is done by the one step that already knows what landed — the loop's
merge step, which writes `subject:` for exactly this reason:

- On merging a job, the loop SHALL write into that job's verdict record a
  `reviewed:` mapping from each merged content path to the SHA-256 of that
  file's **reviewed surface**, derived from the same measurement of the branch
  that produces `subject:` — one measurement, two fields, so the two can never
  describe different diffs.
- A piece's **reviewed surface** SHALL be its prose body together with its front
  matter with every mechanically-maintained key removed, and the list of
  mechanically-maintained keys SHALL live in exactly one declared place in
  `lib/`. The exclusion is not a convenience: `pulse` appends dated lifecycle
  events to an entry's `timeline` mechanically, under the review exemption, so a
  hash over whole file bytes would mark every entry mismatched the first time
  the world changed a status — a guardrail that fires on its own machinery is
  noise, and noise is how a guardrail gets switched off.
- The set of paths in `reviewed:` SHALL equal the set of joinable content paths
  written to `subject:`, and the merge SHALL refuse a record where they differ,
  in the same place and on the same terms it refuses an `approve` with an empty
  `would-cite`.
- The value shape of `subject:` SHALL NOT change. It is read by nine accepted
  key names in `lib/reviews.mjs` and by hand-written records; carrying the hash
  inside it would break the join for every record that already exists, which is
  the opposite of the outcome this requirement is for.

A record with no `reviewed:` key is not invalid — every record written before
the merge began writing that key is one. It is a distinct, reported state,
defined in the next requirement.

#### Scenario: The merge binds the record to what it merged

- **WHEN** a job merges `content/wiki/org/moonshot-ai.md` with an approving
  verdict
- **THEN** the verdict record carries both `subject:` naming that path and
  `reviewed:` giving that path's reviewed-surface hash, written from the same
  branch measurement

#### Scenario: A mechanical timeline append is not an edit to reviewed text

- **WHEN** the Pulse appends a dated status event to an approved entry's
  `timeline` and nothing else in the file changes
- **THEN** the entry's reviewed-surface hash is unchanged and the record still
  reads as bound

#### Scenario: A record that names one thing and hashes another does not merge

- **WHEN** a verdict record's `reviewed:` paths differ from the joinable paths
  the merge measured for `subject:`
- **THEN** the merge refuses the record and names both sets

### Requirement: Missing, unbound, and mismatched are three findings, not one

`lib/reviews.mjs`'s header already reasons that "unreviewed" and "named
something the join does not recognise" are the same observation from the join's
position, and that absence must therefore be reported rather than acted on.
Reviewed-then-changed is the third member of that family, and today the check
cannot tell it from the other two.

- The join SHALL classify every reviewable piece into exactly one of four
  states: **recorded** (a record joins and its recorded hash equals the piece's
  current reviewed-surface hash), **mismatched** (a record joins, carries a hash
  for that path, and the hashes differ), **unbound** (a record joins and carries
  no hash for that path), and **missing** (no record joins).
- Every path that reports on reviews — `scripts/verify-launch.mjs` and the
  prebuild's summary line — SHALL report the four states separately and SHALL
  NOT collapse mismatched into missing. They are opposite findings: missing
  means unreviewed, mismatched means reviewed and then changed, and only the
  second identifies both a specific record and the specific bytes that moved.
- `scripts/verify-launch.mjs` SHALL fail on any **mismatched** piece, naming the
  piece, the record, and the fact that the reviewed surface changed after the
  verdict.
- **Unbound** SHALL be counted and reported and SHALL NOT fail anything. Every
  record written before the merge began binding hashes is unbound, so failing on
  unbound would refuse the whole corpus of records that predate the mechanism —
  and an unbound record is exactly as informative as a record was before binding
  existed, no worse. The number to watch is that it only ever falls.
- A **mismatched** state SHALL NOT change a page's indexability. The build's
  review gate continues to read the verdict alone. Suppressing a page because
  its bytes moved would silently de-index approved work over a whitespace edit,
  which is the response `lib/reviews.mjs` already refuses to give to absence,
  for the same reason.

#### Scenario: An edited approved page is a named finding

- **WHEN** an approved entry's prose is edited after its verdict and the launch
  check runs
- **THEN** the check fails, naming that piece as mismatched against its record,
  and does not report it as missing a review

#### Scenario: A pre-existing record is unbound, not broken

- **WHEN** a seed record carrying no `reviewed:` key joins its piece
- **THEN** the piece reports as unbound, the count of unbound pieces is printed,
  and nothing fails

#### Scenario: A mismatch does not unpublish anything

- **WHEN** a piece is mismatched against its record
- **THEN** its rendered page's indexability is exactly what the verdict alone
  would produce, and no page is de-indexed by the mismatch
