# review — delta for build-initial-site

## Purpose

Mandatory review: every change the loop proposes and every piece of content
it produces is reviewed before it publishes. Review was the highest-value
part of the previous machinery — on one representative day nine review rounds
each found something real that no automated check had caught — and it is
designed here to be light enough that it never becomes the bottleneck that
stops entries shipping.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Nothing model-written publishes unreviewed, and no run reviews its own output

Every job whose diff contains model-written or model-edited content (prose,
entry data changes beyond feed binding, machinery code) SHALL be reviewed
before merge. The reviewer SHALL be a separate invocation with a fresh
context and no edit rights — a different model where `runners.yml` clears
one for `reviewer`, otherwise the same model freshly invoked. The authoring
run and the reviewing run are never the same session; self-review is not
review.

**The one exemption:** deterministic outputs of already-reviewed machinery —
Pulse feed refreshes, derived tables, computed banners, the derived queue —
publish without per-run review, because the machinery that produces them was
reviewed when it merged and they contain no model judgment. Anything a model
wrote in the run is never inside this exemption.

#### Scenario: Fresh eyes or no merge

- **WHEN** a job finishes with a diff containing model-written prose
- **THEN** the merge is blocked until a separate reviewer invocation returns
  an explicit verdict on that diff

#### Scenario: The Pulse publishes data without review

- **WHEN** the Pulse's scheduled run updates the model catalog from a feed
  and rebuilds
- **THEN** no review is required, because no model wrote anything in that
  run

### Requirement: The reviewer judges quality with full standing, from a named reason list

The reviewer SHALL return exactly one verdict — `approve`, `revise` (with
the required changes named), or `reject` — with one or more reasons from
this closed list:

- `false-or-unsupported-claim` — a claim the cited source does not support,
  or no source where one is required;
- `intent-not-measurement` — a claim written from what something was meant
  to do rather than a measurement of what it does;
- `not-worth-reading` — dull, derivative, padded, or otherwise not worth a
  reader's time (see `editorial`). **This is a complete rejection reason in
  its own right and never needs to be dressed up as a factual defect.**
- `overclaiming-summary` — title/excerpt claims more than the body proves;
- `spec-violation` — violates a named requirement in these specs;
- `broken-reference` — a transclusion, mention, or link that does not hold;
- `scope-violation` — the diff exceeds the job's stated outcome or touches
  paths it should not.

Verdicts are categorical, never numeric — scores drift and become targets.

#### Scenario: Boring is a verdict

- **WHEN** a factually clean draft is judged not worth a reader's time
- **THEN** the reviewer rejects with `not-worth-reading` and the recorded
  reason says so plainly, with no manufactured factual objection

### Requirement: What is checked depends on what the work is

The reviewer SHALL work from the checklist for the job's kind — reviewing a
wiki entry, a tutorial, and a machinery change are not the same job:

- **Wiki entry**: every cited fact has a reachable source and the source
  says what the fact says (fetch and confirm — do not assume); volatile
  values are transclusions or feed-bound, not literals; aliases sanely
  classed; prose adds something beyond the data.
- **Tutorial**: evidence the steps were actually executed (transcript or
  reproduced outputs) — plausibility is not verification; `subjects`,
  `verified_against`, `verified_on` complete and honest; unexecuted steps
  disclosed; perishables all declared.
- **Blog post**: every external claim source-checked by fetching; title and
  excerpt read against the body for overclaim; company-conduct claims held
  to the news-fact-checking standard; dates explicit.
- **Education page**: no perishable literals; prerequisites and the
  "after this you will understand" statement honest; beats the obvious
  alternative.
- **Directory/curated data**: spot-check changed rows against their sources.
- **Machinery change**: run the changed check or script and confirm the
  claimed behavior — red before, green after where applicable; every claim
  about what the change does verified by executing, not by reading; guard
  rails tested by attempting what they forbid.

In every kind, the reviewer's standing instruction is: **for every claim
about what something does, run the cheap direct check; for every sourced
claim, confirm the source supports it.** The defect class this review exists
to catch is the claim written from intent rather than measurement — found
repeatedly by skeptical readers on the previous site and never once by an
automated check.

#### Scenario: The reviewer measures instead of reading

- **WHEN** a machinery diff claims "this makes X impossible"
- **THEN** the reviewer attempts X against the changed code and the verdict
  cites the attempt's observed result, not the diff's description

### Requirement: Rejection has mechanics and an end

A `revise` or `reject` verdict SHALL name the reason(s) from the list and
the specific locations at issue. What happens next:

1. `revise`: the authoring side (same job, fresh or resumed run) gets
   exactly one revision pass against the named findings, then a delta
   review of only what changed.
2. A second non-approval SHALL discard the job: branch closed, one-line
   record of the reasons kept. No third pass, no indefinite loop.
3. A discarded piece may return only as a new job with new evidence or a
   changed approach; the record of the prior rejection travels with it.

Disagreement resolves in the reviewer's favor by default: the author never
overrules the reviewer, and nothing publishes on a tie. If the authoring
side believes the rejection itself violates these specs, it MAY file a beads
issue for the maintainer; the work stays unpublished meanwhile. Review is
bounded by construction — one review, one revision, one delta review — so it
can never become an unbounded gate that stops entries shipping; a review
that delays publication indefinitely has failed exactly as review skipped.

#### Scenario: Two strikes and the branch closes

- **WHEN** a revised draft fails its delta review
- **THEN** the job is discarded with reasons recorded, and the loop moves on

### Requirement: Review survives a model swap, and its limits are stated

Review MUST keep working when the reviewer is a weaker model than the
author, or the same model twice:

- **What holds regardless of models**: fresh context (the reviewer never
  sees the author's reasoning, only the diff and the checklist); no edit
  rights; the mechanical parts of every checklist (fetch the source and
  compare; run the command and read the output; check the fields exist),
  which do not require matching the author's capability; and the named
  reason list.
- **What weakens and is accepted as weakened**: subtle quality judgment from
  a weaker reviewer, and blind-spot correlation when the same model reviews
  itself (same model twice retains fresh-context independence — the
  historical record shows fresh eyes finding real defects even same-model —
  but loses family-level diversity). When `runners.yml` has only one model
  family, that thinner protection is a fact, not a failure.
- A weaker reviewer's `not-worth-reading` verdict is valid signal, not
  malfunction: if a weaker reader finds a piece dull, that is evidence about
  readers.

#### Scenario: A weaker reviewer still catches the catchable

- **WHEN** the reviewer model is weaker than the author model
- **THEN** source-fetch verification, command execution, field checks, and
  overclaim comparison still run and still block on failure — the mechanical
  floor of review does not depend on reviewer strength
