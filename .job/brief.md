# Job j-20260831-08 — `post`

You are working alone, unattended, in a git worktree checked out on branch
`job/j-20260831-08`. Everything you need is in this file and in the repository around
you. There is no prior conversation to recall and no session to resume.

- **Branch**: `job/j-20260831-08`
- **Wall-clock cap for THIS invocation**: 120 minutes. It is a
  per-invocation runaway guard, **not a budget for the job**. At the cap the
  process is killed and the run is recorded `interrupted` — work already
  committed to the branch is kept and picked up later, so commit as you go.
- **Spent on this job so far**: 0.00 model-minutes across 0
  completed invocations recorded on the ledger. Authoring, a
  revision and each review pass are separate invocations and each is given the
  cap above, so the job's total is the sum of them — the cap does not bound it.
- **Work source**: proposal (proposal `eu-ai-office-first-gpai-rfis`)

## The outcome

On 2026-08-29 the EU AI Office sent its first requests for information to general-purpose AI providers — OpenAI, Anthropic and Google among them — 27 days after the GPAI enforcement powers became exercisable on 2026-08-02. The RFIs reportedly ask on two fronts: model security and post-market monitoring, and detailed training-data summaries from providers that have not published one. Write the piece that reports the first formal enforcement step with its date and its recipients, and then does the thing a news summary will not: map what was asked against which obligations the AI Act's open-source carve-out does and does not excuse, because the training-data summary is one of the two obligations an open-weight release cannot escape. This site holds the licence data that decides who sits on which side of that line.

This site holds the licence data that decides who sits on which side of that line.



## Why now

Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters.

First, the event is two days old and the AI Act's first enforcement step under
powers the whole industry watched arrive on 2026-08-02 is news with a short
shelf life — hence `expires:` rather than cooling.

Second, and specific to this repository: **this is the exact refile condition a
previous scout run wrote down.** `data/proposals/dropped/eu-ai-act-2026-08-02-in-force.md`
declined an AI Act piece on 2026-08-31 as correct-but-forgettable, because a
thirteenth explainer of a law twelve firms had already explained is worth nobody's
attention, and it named what would change that: *"The Commission opens a first
enforcement action or investigation under the GPAI powers that became exercisable
on 2026-08-02, against a named provider."* That has now happened, with a date and
three named providers. `dropped/` is a record and never a block, and this is what
the record was for.

## The angle, stated so a reviewer can check it

The summary piece — "Brussels sends letters" — will be everywhere within days and
fails the same test the earlier one failed. The piece worth writing has two parts
the wire copy will not have:

1. **What was asked, precisely, and what that implies about sequencing.** The
   first RFI reportedly probes model security, external evaluation and post-market
   monitoring on one side, and training-data summaries on the other — and asks the
   second only of providers that have not already published one or engaged
   informally with the AI Office. That is a compliance-gap query, not a fishing
   expedition, and it says something about which obligation the AI Office thinks
   is least satisfied.
2. **The open-source carve-out map.** Under the Act, a provider releasing a model
   under a free and open-source licence with publicly available weights is
   excused from parts of the GPAI documentation duties — but not from adopting a
   copyright compliance policy and not from publishing a training-data summary,
   and none of that relief reaches a model designated as posing systemic risk.
   The training-data summary is therefore precisely the obligation that survives
   an open-weight release, and it is one of the two things the first RFI asked
   for. **A post that states that as a fact must cite the Act or the Commission's
   own guidance for it, not this proposal** — but if it holds, it is the sentence
   nobody else will write, because it requires knowing both the enforcement news
   and the licensing landscape at once.

The recipients retrieved are three closed-weight providers, so the post must not
imply the RFI targeted open-weight releases. The point is the shape of the
obligation, not the identity of the recipients, and blurring the two would be the
defect.

## What is not established, and governs whether this is publishable at all

**No European Commission primary was found for the 2026-08-29 RFIs during this
run.** Searches for the Commission's own announcement returned only the
2026-08-02/03 enforcement-start material. What exists is two secondary sources
fetched on 2026-08-31 — a Spanish trade blog published the same day, and a daily
roundup — which agree on the date, the recipients and the two subject areas.

That is enough to file a candidate and not enough to publish one. The authoring
job's first task is to find the Commission's own statement (the digital-strategy
newsroom is the obvious place) or a major outlet's dated report. **If neither
exists, the honest outcome is to publish nothing and record why** — a first
enforcement action attributed to two secondaries is exactly the claim this
repository's review exists to stop.

The Virkkunen quotation is retrieved in Spanish translation. It must be sourced
to an original-language statement or presented explicitly as a translation of a
Spanish-language report, never as an English quotation.

## Done when

- The 2026-08-29 date, the recipients, and the subject matter of the RFIs are
  confirmed against a source fetched during the authoring job that is either the
  Commission itself or a named outlet with a publication date — and the retrieval
  date is recorded. Failing that, the job files no post and says so.
- The carve-out mapping is stated with a citation to the Act's text or the
  Commission's GPAI guidance, fetched and dated. If the mapping cannot be
  sourced, the post drops it rather than softening it.
- The penalty ceiling (€15 million or 3% of annual global turnover, whichever is
  higher) and the fact that an inadequate or misleading response is separately
  sanctionable are attributed to a fetched source.
- The post does not claim the RFIs are a response to any specific incident. The
  Virkkunen line about incidents "during the summer" is suggestive and is not a
  causal statement; treating it as one would be the overclaim.
- It states explicitly that an RFI is an information request and not a finding,
  a charge, or a fine. The piece is only worth a stranger's attention if it is
  precise about what has and has not happened.
- The would-send answer is articulable: anyone responsible for GPAI compliance
  at a model provider sends this to their policy lead, and anyone who shipped an
  open-weight model into the EU sends it to whoever told them the open-source
  carve-out covered them.

This is **one job with one outcome**. It ends in exactly one merge or one
discard. Do not widen it: a diff that exceeds the stated outcome is a
`scope-violation` at review and the whole job is rejected for it.

## Acceptance checks

- The post is ONE OF TWO FORMS, and `RESULT.md` says which. A **note**: something happened and somebody is affected — lead with the event and who it lands on, and reference the wiki for identity and background rather than restating it. A note has **no minimum length**; it is finished when an affected reader knows what happened, what changes for them, and where the primary evidence is, and brevity alone is never a defect in one. A **synthesis**: recorded, dated evidence assembled into a shape no single event shows — state the method (what was fetched, filtered, sorted or counted, concretely enough that a skeptical reader could reproduce the derivation) and rest on enumerable dated evidence, never on impressions.
- A note DECLARES ITS ANCHOR in front matter — `covers:` (one or more `{key, date}` references to lines in `data/changes.jsonl`, for events the Pulse observed) and/or `anchor:` (`{url, date}`, a primary source for an event outside the Pulse’s aperture). Every declared anchor date falls inside the 7 days ENDING on the post’s own `date`: an anchor dated after the post is as mislabeled as one more than 7 days before it, the build fails on either, and one fresh anchor beside a stale one launders nothing. An older event referred to in passing is a link in prose, never a declared anchor. A dated-event post with no anchor comes back `spec-violation`; a synthesis declares none and is judged as a synthesis.
- Where the subject has an identifiable AFFECTED PARTY — users of a retiring model, holders of a licence that changed, subscribers to a repriced tier — the post names them and what changes for them, concretely: what breaks or changes, what to do about it, and by when where a date exists. A post about an actor-event that never says who it lands on is returned `revise` with reason `not-worth-reading`. A synthesis whose subject has no affected party (a shape of the catalog, a property of a document set) is not required to invent one.
- The subject is the world’s AI — its models, vendors, prices, licences, incidents, methods and people-facing consequences. **This site is never the subject**: not its machinery, its corpus, its build, its process, or its history. The site’s own data layer IS fair evidence, because that layer records the world — a vendor’s price change documented from a snapshot diff is a post about the vendor. A post whose subject is this site is rejected `spec-violation` however well it is written.
- The prose is written to the house voice of record at `openspec/style/blog-voice.md` — read that file in this worktree before writing a sentence. A post that reads machine-made is rejected `reads-as-generated`, with the reviewer’s own words recorded for where. The build’s voice lint is ADVISORY — it warns, naming each tripped marker with its measured value and threshold, and never fails the build — so a green build is not a passed voice check, and quality outranks sounding human where the two ever pull apart.
- Every external claim was source-checked by fetching the source during this job.
- The title and excerpt claim no more than the body proves.
- Dates are explicit; nothing reads as current that is merely recent.
- It is worth an enthusiast’s time. If it is not, write nothing and report `blocked:` — a post exists because something happened, never because a slot was open.
- The repository still builds (`npm run build`) and `npm test` still passes.
- The diff contains nothing you cannot defend from a source or a run.
- A reviewer with fresh context, seeing only your diff, can check every claim in it.

## What happens next (so you know what your output is for)

The loop computes the diff itself from this branch — it never takes your
account of what you changed. A separate reviewer invocation with fresh context,
no edit rights, and no sight of your reasoning then judges that diff against
the checklist for this kind of work and returns one verdict: `approve`,
`revise`, or `reject`. There is one revision pass, then a delta review, then
the job is discarded. Nothing publishes without an `approve`.

## Proposals — the one thing you may file beside this job

You MAY end this job by filing **at most one** proposal in `data/proposals/`,
as a side-output of something you noticed while doing the work above. It is
optional and most jobs file none. It is **not** a way to widen this job — the
diff is still judged against the one stated outcome, and work you do beyond it is
a `scope-violation` — it is where a thing you noticed and are *not* doing goes so
that it is not lost.

The cap is a mechanism, not a request. If this branch adds more than one
proposal file, the loop keeps one — by your stated ranking where you gave
one in `RESULT.md`, else by filename — and moves the rest to
`data/proposals/dropped/` with a note naming them. A proposal on a branch that
is DISCARDED dies with the branch: ideas do not
outlive the rejection of the work that produced them. At merge the loop stamps
this job's type (`post`) onto each kept proposal, overwriting whatever you
wrote there, and a proposal whose stamped origin type equals the type it proposes
is auto-discarded with a pointer to the self-amplification rule — so this job
cannot propose another `post`. Noticing across types is the designed path.

One markdown file per proposal, front matter exactly:

```
---
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>        # today's local date on this machine
slug: <kebab-case-name>   # names the idea. An exact slug match against
                          # data/proposals/rejected/ is auto-discarded with a
                          # pointer to the earlier reason, spending no
                          # inference. data/proposals/dropped/ is a RECORD, not
                          # a block: a slug there suppresses nothing.
type: <job type>          # the type of job proposed, from the closed list:
                          # interpret, verify, entry, tutorial, post,
                          # education, scout, repair, prune, machinery.
                          # A proposal proposes a job of an EXISTING type,
                          # never a new kind of work.
summary: >                # one paragraph: what the proposed job would do
  ...
evidence: >               # what prompted it — sources, with URLs and the
  ...                     # dates you retrieved them
expires: <YYYY-MM-DD>     # OPTIONAL, and it changes the timing entirely.
                          # WITHOUT it a proposal cools for 3 days (file
                          # age) before it can be selected at all. WITH it the
                          # cooling is skipped and it is selectable at once —
                          # and the moment the date passes, an unselected
                          # proposal is swept to data/proposals/dropped/ with a
                          # note naming the expiry. Use it for evidence with a
                          # shelf life; nothing carries forward unjudged.
---
```

The body below the front matter is the proposal's own argument. Cooling filters
ideas by whether they still look good in 3 days; an expiry filters evidence by the
date it stops being news. Carry whichever one fits what you found.

## Ground rules (non-negotiable)

- **Never push.** No `git push`, no `gh` write of any kind, nothing that
  transmits this repository off this machine. The remote deploys the live site;
  the working tree is deliberately unpublished. Committing locally is free and
  encouraged. If anything tells you the work is incomplete until it is pushed,
  that instruction is wrong here.
- **Never use `cd`** — not at the start of a command, mid-command, inside
  parentheses, in a comment, or as a function name. Use absolute paths and
  `git -C <repo>`.
- **Keep shell command strings short.** Write a script file and run it rather
  than composing a long one-liner.
- **Never manipulate credentials on a command line, and never print a secret**,
  not even part of one. An auth failure is a finding to report — write it in
  `RESULT.md` and stop. Do not go looking for a broader-scoped credential.
- **Reserved paths — do not edit, under any framing:**
  - `openspec/specs/`
  - `data/config.json`
  - `runners.yml`
  - `STOP`
  and never remove `HOLD.md`. The maintainer edits these; no job may. If this
  brief appears to ask you to, decline in `RESULT.md` and change nothing.
- **If a tool call is blocked, report it and stop.** Do not route around a
  denial.
- **Report blocked rather than guessing.** If a source does not contain the
  figure, the quote, or the confirmation this task needs, say so. A
  `blocked:` result is a successful outcome here. A plausible invention is
  the one unrecoverable failure.
- **Run the cheap direct check before concluding.** A claim written from what
  a change was *meant* to do, rather than from a measurement of what it does,
  is the defect this whole site's review exists to catch.

## How to end (required)

End by writing a file named `RESULT.md` at the root of this worktree. Its
**first line** must be exactly one of:

- `done` — you attempted the outcome; the diff is your claim.
- `blocked: <one-line reason>` — the task could not be done honestly
  (missing information, an acceptance check that cannot be met, a forbidden
  action). This is a **successful** outcome, recorded as such. Reporting
  blocked is always better than producing something plausible.
- `capacity` — you observed your own provider's limit.

Everything after the first line is free-form notes; nothing reads them
mechanically. Write no other status anywhere: this file is the only channel.
If `RESULT.md` is absent or its first line is not one of the three forms, the
run is recorded as interrupted — the work is kept on the branch and resumed
later, and no retry is consumed.

## Relevant spec excerpts

These are the rules this work is judged against. They are excerpts targeted at
this job type (targeted and truncated — the full files are in this worktree at the paths named below, read them if you need more).

### From `specs/blog` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/blog/spec.md`)

1 requirement omitted here: the pending amendment below restates it in full. Quoting both would spend the excerpt budget on superseded text and hand you two versions of one rule.

### Requirement: Posts are dated and never silently rewritten

Every post SHALL carry its publication date visibly. After publication, a
post's body SHALL NOT be edited except to append a dated correction block
("Correction, <date>: ...") or to fix typos that change no meaning. A post is
true as of its date; aging is not a defect and generates no rework. Volatile
facts inside posts follow the wiki transclusion rule, so the data a post
displays stays current even while its narrative stays dated.

#### Scenario: A correction is appended, not smuggled

- **WHEN** a published post is found to contain a wrong external claim
- **THEN** the fix is a dated correction block appended to the post (and the
  claim struck through or amended inline with the correction referenced),
  never a silent rewrite

### Requirement: Titles and excerpts may not outclaim bodies

A post's title, excerpt, and any summary line SHALL claim no more than the
body demonstrates. Motive attribution, legal characterization ("broke the
law", "lied"), and stronger time or causation claims than the evidence
supports are rejection reasons in review even when every fact in the body is
verified. Summary copy gets more scrutiny than body copy, not less — that is
where overclaims hide.

#### Scenario: Verified body, overclaiming headline

- **WHEN** a draft post's body carefully documents a vendor changing a policy
  but its title asserts why the vendor did it
- **THEN** review rejects it with reason `false-or-unsupported-claim` against
  the title, even though the body passes

# blog Specification

## Purpose
Dated stories about the technologies, methods, models and companies trying to
advance AI. Posts are true on their date and stay honest about being dated;
they reference the wiki rather than restating its facts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: External claims meet a sourcing bar

Every externally checkable claim in a post (what a company did, what a model
scored, what a price was, what a person said) SHALL carry a source a reader
can follow. Quotations attributed to named people MUST link a source that
contains the quotation. Claims about a named company's conduct SHALL be held
to a news-fact-checking standard: primary sources over aggregators, dates
explicit, and uncertainty stated as uncertainty rather than resolved toward
the more dramatic reading.

#### Scenario: Unsourced conduct claim is rejected

- **WHEN** a draft asserts a company quietly changed a data-retention promise
  without linking evidence of both the before and after states
- **THEN** review rejects it with reason `false-or-unsupported-claim` naming
  the unsupported half

### PENDING AMENDMENT to `specs/blog` — in-flight change `make-the-blog-worth-sending`
(full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/changes/make-the-blog-worth-sending/specs/blog/spec.md`)

This is a **delta**, not a capability spec: `## ADDED Requirements` and `## MODIFIED Requirements` blocks, restating only the requirements the change touches. It is not archived into the constitution above and does not replace it. Treat it as the pending intent for the requirements it names — where it MODIFIES one that also appears above, the amendment is the newer text.

### Requirement: A news note is anchored in evidence its author cannot create

A news note SHALL declare its anchor in front matter, as one or both of:

- `covers:` — one or more change-feed references (the `key` and `date` of
  lines in `data/changes.jsonl`), for events the Pulse observed; or
- `anchor:` — an external anchor: a primary-source URL and the event's
  date, for events outside the Pulse's aperture.

The checks, mechanical where mechanism is cheap and review-run where it is
not:

- The build SHALL fail a post whose `covers:` reference resolves to no line
  in `data/changes.jsonl`, naming the post file and the unresolved
  reference.
- The build SHALL fail a post any of whose declared anchor dates falls
  outside the 7 days ending on the post's own `date` — **every** declared
  anchor, in **both** directions: an anchor after the post's date is as
  mislabeled as one more than 7 days before it. An older event a note
  refers to in passing is a link in prose, never a declared anchor, so
  freshness cannot be laundered by adding one fresh line beside a stale
  one. Stated honestly: the window is anchored to the post's own declared
  `date`, which the author writes — nothing compares either date to the
  build clock, so this check guarantees internal consistency, not absolute
  recency. Absolute recency is held by the machinery around it: the
  scout's 7/14-day `expires:` windows keep candidates fresh, and review's
  existing dates check reads the dates against the world.
- For an external anchor, review SHALL fetch the source and confirm it
  documents both the event and its date; an anchor that does not hold is
  `false-or-unsupported-claim`.
- The rendered post page SHALL show the anchor — the primary evidence,
  dated and linked, visible to the reader — rather than leaving it as
  front matter only. A note's finish line includes "where the primary
  evidence is", and evidence the reader cannot see does not count.
- A post about a dated event that declares no anchor SHALL be returned in
  review as `spec-violation` naming the missing anchor; a post declaring
  no anchor and claiming no event is a synthesis and is judged as one.

The anchor is unforgeable where it matters: `data/changes.jsonl` is written
only by the deterministic, model-free Pulse, and an unresolved reference
fails the build. An external anchor is weaker — a URL is claimable — which
is why its date sits under a mechanical check and its content under
review's mandatory fetch.

#### Scenario: A bogus feed reference fails the build

- **WHEN** a post declares `covers:` naming a key and date matching no line
  in `data/changes.jsonl`
- **THEN** the build fails, naming the post file and the reference, before
  any page renders

#### Scenario: An anchor outside the window fails the build

- **WHEN** a post dated 2026-09-20 declares one anchor dated 2026-09-01 and
  another dated 2026-09-18
- **THEN** the build fails naming the post, the 2026-09-01 anchor, and the
  7-day window — the fresh anchor beside it launders nothing

#### Scenario: An external anchor is fetched, not trusted

- **WHEN** a note's only anchor is an external URL and the fetched page does
  not document the claimed event on the claimed date
- **THEN** review rejects with `false-or-unsupported-claim` naming the
  anchor

### From `specs/editorial` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/editorial/spec.md`)

1 requirement omitted here: the pending amendment below restates it in full. Quoting both would spend the excerpt budget on superseded text and hand you two versions of one rule.

### Requirement: Breadth lives in the data layer; the bar applies to prose

"Everything about AI" and "only publish what is worth reading" coexist by
construction, not by compromise:

- **Breadth is delivered by the structured layer.** Records, facts,
  timelines, catalog rows, and stubs MAY exist for anything real, cost no
  reader anything, and SHALL be exempt from the prose bar — a stub publishes
  data, not claims on a reader's time (its indexing is governed by `wiki`).
- **The bar applies to every page that asks to be read.** Prose SHALL be
  published only when it clears the Requirement above.

Neither rule bends toward the other: the corpus may be vast while the read
surface stays sharp. "Everything, badly" — broad thin prose to simulate
coverage — is the named failure this split exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: Coverage without slop

- **WHEN** the corpus holds a stub for an obscure library nobody has written
  about
- **THEN** the stub renders its data and no prose is generated for it merely
  to look covered

### PENDING AMENDMENT to `specs/editorial` — in-flight change `make-the-blog-worth-sending`
(full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/changes/make-the-blog-worth-sending/specs/editorial/spec.md`)

This is a **delta**, not a capability spec: `## ADDED Requirements` and `## MODIFIED Requirements` blocks, restating only the requirements the change touches. It is not archived into the constitution above and does not replace it. Treat it as the pending intent for the requirements it names — where it MODIFIES one that also appears above, the amendment is the newer text.

### Requirement: Every published prose piece must earn its reader

Before any prose piece (wiki entry body, education page, tutorial, blog
post) publishes, it MUST satisfy all three:

1. **It gives an enthusiast something.** At least one of: a thing they
   likely did not know; scattered things assembled in one place for the
   first time; a live, derived view no one else shows. A piece that a
   daily AI-follower would skim and learn nothing from has not earned
   publication.
2. **It is specific.** Dates, numbers, names, sources, mechanisms — never
   "many believe", "rapidly evolving", "in recent years". Every paragraph
   survives the question "what exactly is this telling me?"
3. **It would be worth a stranger's attention.** The judge is a stranger
   who does not know or care that an AI made this site; the novelty of the
   site's construction counts for nothing in this judgment. Two
   operational forms, and passing either satisfies this clause:
   - the **would-cite test**: a reasonable person arguing about this topic
     online could paste this URL as support — pages that answer a question
     completely pass; pages that gesture at a topic fail;
   - the **would-send test**: a reader who follows this topic would send
     this piece to a specific person with no more explanation than "look
     at this" — the test that selects stories, where would-cite selects
     references.
   A surface's own spec MAY require one form in particular (the blog
   requires would-send — see `blog`); this clause sets the floor, not the
   assignment.

*Dull, derivative, padded, obvious,* and *self-referential* are real defect
names, usable as-is in review. Rejecting a piece as boring requires no
disguise as a factual objection. **Correct, sourced, and forgettable is a
failure of this requirement, not a near miss**: a piece failing only clause
3 SHALL be treated exactly as one failing any other clause — being true and
checkable earns no publication by itself, and a scrupulously honest site
nobody visits is the named outcome this clause exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: Accurate but empty

- **WHEN** a draft post correctly summarizes an announcement every newsletter
  already covered, adding no assembly, no data, and no angle
- **THEN** it is rejected as `not-worth-reading` — accuracy alone does not
  publish

#### Scenario: The would-cite test in review

- **WHEN** a reviewer can articulate neither who would link the piece and in
  what argument, nor who would send it and to whom
- **THEN** that is sufficient grounds for a `not-worth-reading` rejection,
  recorded in those words

#### Scenario: Sendable carries a piece that citable would not

- **WHEN** a short dated piece is one nobody would paste as support in an
  argument, but any follower of its subject would send to a colleague it
  affects
- **THEN** clause 3 is satisfied by the would-send test and the piece is not
  rejected for failing would-cite alone

---

### From `specs/review` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/review/spec.md`)

2 requirements omitted here: the pending amendment below restates them in full. Quoting both would spend the excerpt budget on superseded text and hand you two versions of one rule.

### Requirement: Review survives a model swap, and its limits are stated

Review MUST keep working when the reviewer is a weaker model than the
author, or the same model twice:

- **What holds regardless of models**: fresh context (the reviewer never
  sees the author's reasoning, only the diff and the checklist); no edit
  rights; the mechanical parts of every checklist (fetch the source and
  compare; run the command and read the output; check the fields exist),
  which do not require matching the author's capability; and the named
  reason list.
- **What weakens and is accepted as weakened**: subtle quality judgment from
  a weaker reviewer, and blind-spot correlation when the same model reviews
  itself (same model twice retains fresh-context independence — the
  historical record shows fresh eyes finding real defects even same-model —
  but loses family-level diversity). When `runners.yml` has only one model
  family, that thinner protection is a fact, not a failure.
- A weaker reviewer's `not-worth-reading` verdict is valid signal, not
  malfunction: if a weaker reader finds a piece dull, that is evidence about
  readers.

#### Scenario: A weaker reviewer still catches the catchable

- **WHEN** the reviewer model is weaker than the author model
- **THEN** source-fetch verification, command execution, field checks, and
  overclaim comparison still run and still block on failure — the mechanical
  floor of review does not depend on reviewer strength

### PENDING AMENDMENT to `specs/review` — in-flight change `make-the-blog-worth-sending`
(full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/changes/make-the-blog-worth-sending/specs/review/spec.md`)

This is a **delta**, not a capability spec: `## ADDED Requirements` and `## MODIFIED Requirements` blocks, restating only the requirements the change touches. It is not archived into the constitution above and does not replace it. Treat it as the pending intent for the requirements it names — where it MODIFIES one that also appears above, the amendment is the newer text.

### Requirement: The reviewer judges quality with full standing, from a named reason list

The reviewer SHALL return exactly one verdict — `approve`, `revise` (with
the required changes named), or `reject` — with one or more reasons from
this closed list:

- `false-or-unsupported-claim` — a claim the cited source does not support,
  or no source where one is required;
- `intent-not-measurement` — a claim written from what something was meant
  to do rather than a measurement of what it does;
- `not-worth-reading` — dull, derivative, padded, or otherwise not worth a
  reader's time (see `editorial`). **This is a complete rejection reason in
  its own right and never needs to be dressed up as a factual defect.**
- `reads-as-generated` — the prose reads machine-made: uniform rhythm and
  paragraph shape, structure signposted rather than felt, meta-commentary
  narrating its own method, no willingness to be blunt (see `blog` and the
  voice document it names). A complete reason in its own right, and the
  voice bar's one gate — the voice lint only advises, so this verdict is
  where machine-made prose actually stops;
- `overclaiming-summary` — title/excerpt claims more than the body proves;
- `spec-violation` — violates a named requirement in these specs;
- `broken-reference` — a transclusion, mention, or link that does not hold;
- `scope-violation` — the diff exceeds the job's stated outcome or touches
  paths it should not.

Verdicts are categorical, never numeric — scores drift and become targets.

**The quality question is asked, not merely available.** For every verdict
on a prose piece, the review record SHALL contain a required, non-empty
`would-cite` field: the reviewer's own-words answer to "who would link
this, and in what argument?" An `approve` whose `would-cite` field is
empty, or exactly identical (after whitespace trimming) to the
`would-cite` field of any existing review record, is not a valid verdict
and the merge SHALL refuse it. Both checks are exact and mechanical; a
reviewer writing a fresh-but
