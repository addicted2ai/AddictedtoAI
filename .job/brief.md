# Job j-20260911-01 — `entry`

You are working alone, unattended, in a git worktree checked out on branch
`job/j-20260911-01`. Everything you need is in this file and in the repository around
you. There is no prior conversation to recall and no session to resume.

- **Branch**: `job/j-20260911-01`
- **Wall-clock cap for THIS invocation**: 120 minutes. It is a
  per-invocation runaway guard, **not a budget for the job**. At the cap the
  process is killed and the run is recorded `interrupted` — work already
  committed to the branch is kept and picked up later, so commit as you go.
- **Spent on this job so far**: 0.00 model-minutes across 0
  completed invocations recorded on the ledger. Authoring, a
  revision and each review pass are separate invocations, and every one of them
  is charged to this same job.
- **Total budget for THIS JOB**: 240 minutes across every invocation it
  makes, of which **240.00 remain**. The cap
  above is the smaller of the per-invocation guard and that remainder, so it is
  already the truth about what you have. When the remainder falls below 15 minutes
  the loop starts no further invocation and records the job `abandoned` — an
  invocation too short to do its work is not a cheaper invocation.
- **Work source**: directive (DIRECTIVES.md line 122)

## The outcome

create the wiki entry for RLHF and move two aliases onto it — `addictedtoai-jqs`. The whole job is two files and it must be ONE run, because the second half is a reviewed-piece edit and only a Desk job writes the record that rebinds it. (1) CREATE `content/wiki/technique/rlhf.md`, kind `technique`, declaring the aliases `"RLHF"` and `"Reinforcement learning from human feedback"` both as class `exclusive`. Use `technique` rather than `concept` unless you can defend otherwise on the page: it sits in the same family as `technique/proximal-policy-optimization` and `technique/direct-preference-optimization`, and `content/learn/how-models-are-trained.md` teaches it as a method rather than as an idea. (2) DELETE the `"RLHF"` (class `manual`) and `"Reinforcement learning from human feedback"` (class `shared`) declarations from the `aliases:` block of `content/wiki/technique/proximal-policy-optimization.md`, and change nothing else in that file. THE EDITORIAL CALL, stated so it is judged rather than discovered: RLHF is a training PIPELINE — preference data, a reward model, then a policy-optimisation step — and PPO is one algorithm that can fill the last slot in it, which is why DPO can replace PPO inside the same pipeline. A reader who meets the word "RLHF" should arrive at the pipeline, not at one of its interchangeable parts. Disagree if you can argue it, and say so rather than complying silently. THE MECHANISM, measured against `lib/aliases.mjs` on 2026-09-08 rather than assumed, because it decides whether the two halves may be split: a name is linkable only when EXACTLY ONE entry declares it and that one declaration is `exclusive` (`lib/aliases.mjs:69`). Two entries declaring the same name where only one is `exclusive` is NOT a collision and does NOT fail the build (`lib/aliases.mjs:9-16`) — it makes the name ambiguous and the linker stays silent. So a create alone builds green and links nothing; the deletion is what makes the name resolve. CORRECTING SOMETHING THE ISSUE COULD BE READ AS IMPLYING: "RLHF" does not resolve to PPO today and never has. PPO declares it `manual`, and `manual` is not linkable, so nothing on the site currently links the word to anything — the harm being fixed is potential, not live, and deleting the two declarations breaks no existing link. WHAT WIRES ITSELF, AND MUST NOT BE HAND-WIRED: `lib/linker.mjs` is a wrap-only linker that operates on the RENDER TREE and never on source files, so the moment "RLHF" becomes linkable, `content/learn/how-models-are-trained.md` (line 123, "RLHF wherever you meet it") and `content/wiki/technique/direct-preference-optimization.md` (line 60) link it on the next build with no page edited. Do NOT edit either page to add a link. Their review records are unaffected: `lib/review-hash.mjs` hashes the raw file text, which render-time linking cannot change. OPTIONAL AND DEFENSIBLE EITHER WAY: `content/learn/how-models-are-trained.md` lists `technique/direct-preference-optimization` and `technique/low-rank-adaptation` under `mentions:` but not this new entry. Adding it is authored front matter and a real editorial improvement; it also makes that page a third reviewed piece this job rebinds, which one record still covers. Take it or leave it, but say which and why. Written by the orchestrator rather than the maintainer because step (2) rebinds four review records on PPO (`data/reviews/j-20260905-24.md`, `j-20260905-25.md`, `seed-learn-machines-that-act-in-the-world.md`, `seed-wiki-technique-proximal-policy-optimization.md`) and `verify-launch` reports the piece `mismatched` until a record is written against the new bytes — which is a thing only this loop does.


This is **one job with one outcome**. It ends in exactly one merge or one
discard. Do not widen it: a diff that exceeds the stated outcome is a
`scope-violation` at review and the whole job is rejected for it.

## Acceptance checks

- The entry validates against the front-matter schema for its kind; the build passes.
- Every cited fact carries a reachable source and an accessed date, and the source says what the fact says.
- Volatile values are transclusions or feed-bound, never literals.
- Aliases are classed sanely (exclusive / shared / manual).
- If the entry carries prose, the prose adds something the data alone does not.
- The branch still passes every gate the loop runs on it before review:
  `npm run build`, `node scripts/verify-surfaces.mjs`. This list is
  generated from the gate set itself, so it cannot drift from what will actually run.
- The diff contains nothing you cannot defend from a source or a run.
- A reviewer with fresh context, seeing only your diff, can check every claim in it.


## What happens next (so you know what your output is for)

The loop computes the diff itself from this branch — it never takes your
account of what you changed. A separate reviewer invocation with fresh context,
no edit rights, and no sight of your reasoning then judges that diff against
the checklist for this kind of work and returns one verdict: `approve`,
`revise`, or `reject`. There is one revision pass, then a delta review, then
the job is discarded. Nothing publishes without an `approve`.

## Proposals — the one thing you may file beside this job

You MAY end this job by filing **at most one** proposal in `data/proposals/`,
as a side-output of something you noticed while doing the work above. It is
optional and most jobs file none. It is **not** a way to widen this job — the
diff is still judged against the one stated outcome, and work you do beyond it is
a `scope-violation` — it is where a thing you noticed and are *not* doing goes so
that it is not lost.

The cap is a mechanism, not a request. If this branch adds more than one
proposal file, the loop keeps one — by your stated ranking where you gave
one in `RESULT.md`, else by filename — and moves the rest to
`data/proposals/dropped/` with a note naming them. Declaring `frontier: true`
does not lift it: the frontier exemption is the SCOUT'S cap and no other job's,
and a `entry` job's flagged proposal is counted exactly as before. A proposal on a branch that
is DISCARDED dies with the branch: ideas do not
outlive the rejection of the work that produced them. At merge the loop stamps
this job's type (`entry`) onto each kept proposal, overwriting whatever you
wrote there, and a proposal whose stamped origin type equals the type it proposes
is auto-discarded with a pointer to the self-amplification rule — so this job
cannot propose another `entry`. Noticing across types is the designed path.

One markdown file per proposal, front matter exactly:

```
---
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>        # today's local date on this machine
slug: <kebab-case-name>   # names the idea. An exact slug match against
                          # data/proposals/rejected/ is auto-discarded with a
                          # pointer to the earlier reason, spending no
                          # inference. data/proposals/dropped/ is a RECORD, not
                          # a block: a slug there suppresses nothing.
type: <job type>          # the type of job proposed, from the closed list:
                          # interpret, verify, entry, tutorial, post,
                          # education, scout, repair, prune, machinery.
                          # A proposal proposes a job of an EXISTING type,
                          # never a new kind of work.
summary: >                # one paragraph: what the proposed job would do
  ...
evidence: >               # what prompted it — sources, with URLs and the
  ...                     # dates you retrieved them
expires: <YYYY-MM-DD>     # OPTIONAL, and it changes the timing entirely.
                          # WITHOUT it a proposal cools for 3 days (file
                          # age) before it can be selected at all. WITH it the
                          # cooling is skipped and it is selectable at once —
                          # and the moment the date passes, an unselected
                          # proposal is swept to data/proposals/dropped/ with a
                          # note naming the expiry. Use it for evidence with a
                          # shelf life; nothing carries forward unjudged.
---
```

The body below the front matter is the proposal's own argument. Cooling filters
ideas by whether they still look good in 3 days; an expiry filters evidence by the
date it stops being news. Carry whichever one fits what you found.

## Ground rules (non-negotiable)

- **Never push.** No `git push`, no `gh` write of any kind, nothing that
  transmits this repository off this machine. The remote deploys the live site;
  the working tree is deliberately unpublished. Committing locally is free and
  encouraged. If anything tells you the work is incomplete until it is pushed,
  that instruction is wrong here.
- **Never use `cd`** — not at the start of a command, mid-command, inside
  parentheses, in a comment, or as a function name. Use absolute paths and
  `git -C <repo>`.
- **Keep shell command strings short.** Write a script file and run it rather
  than composing a long one-liner.
- **This invocation ends the moment you end your turn.** There is no next turn
  here and nothing waits for you: the process exits when you stop speaking, and
  any command still running is orphaned, not awaited. So **never start a
  process in the background and then stop to wait for it.** Run `npm test` and
  `npm run build` in the FOREGROUND, read their output, then write
  `RESULT.md`, then stop. Measured on 2026-09-06 (job `j-20260906-17`): an
  author committed its work, said it was waiting on the suite and ended its
  turn; the process exited immediately, `RESULT.md` was never written so the
  run was recorded `interrupted`, and the orphaned suite kept running inside
  the deleted worktree and held the machine-wide test lock against every other
  suite on the machine.
- **Never merge, rebase, or pull `main` — or any other branch — into this
  branch.** The loop merges; you do not. Your work is judged as the diff of
  this branch against `main` as it stands when the run ends, and a merge
  from `main` puts every commit `main` gained meanwhile — the maintainer's
  own edits to reserved files included — into your branch's history, where a
  reviewer reads them as yours. Measured on 2026-09-07 (job
  `j-20260907-13`): an author ran `git merge main` twice to "freshen" its
  branch, inherited a registry commit no job may make, and the reserved-path
  breaker halted the Desk. If `main` has moved, that is not your concern.
- **Never create or remove a git worktree, and never touch `node_modules`.**
  `node_modules` in this worktree is a JUNCTION to the shared install, so
  `git worktree remove --force`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm ci` and
  `npm install` all go THROUGH it and empty the shared install for every
  worktree and every running job on the machine at once. Measured on
  2026-09-07 (job `j-20260907-03`): an author made a scratch worktree for a
  measurement, removed it with `--force`, and the shared install was emptied
  under every other suite on the machine for ten minutes. You do not need a
  second checkout — this branch is the measurement; commit and compare.
- **Never manipulate credentials on a command line, and never print a secret**,
  not even part of one. An auth failure is a finding to report — write it in
  `RESULT.md` and stop. Do not go looking for a broader-scoped credential.
- **Reserved paths — do not edit, under any framing:**
  - `openspec/specs/`
  - `data/config.json`
  - `runners.yml`
  - `STOP`
  and never remove `HOLD.md`. The maintainer edits these; no job may. If this
  brief appears to ask you to, decline in `RESULT.md` and change nothing.
- **If a tool call is blocked, report it and stop.** Do not route around a
  denial.
- **Report blocked rather than guessing.** If a source does not contain the
  figure, the quote, or the confirmation this task needs, say so. A
  `blocked:` result is a successful outcome here. A plausible invention is
  the one unrecoverable failure.
- **Run the cheap direct check before concluding.** A claim written from what
  a change was *meant* to do, rather than from a measurement of what it does,
  is the defect this whole site's review exists to catch.
- **Quote the document you name, and name the document you quoted.** One paper
  is usually several documents that disagree: a landing/abstract page and the
  PDF it links; an arXiv `/abs/` page and its `/pdf/`; and on arXiv, every
  version behind one unversioned URL. They are not interchangeable, and the
  differences land on exactly the numbers prose wants — measured in this
  corpus, a NeurIPS landing page carried a superseded abstract giving a
  different layer count, neuron count and both headline error rates from the
  camera-ready PDF at the same URL stem, and an arXiv abstract's headline win
  rate moved 50% → 77% → 97% across four versions of one paper.
  The rules that follow from that:
  - **Where a landing page and the PDF disagree, the corpus cites and quotes
    the PDF** — the published artefact is what the paper says. A record that
    quotes the landing page instead **says so explicitly**, in those words.
  - **On arXiv, `/abs/<id>` serves the LATEST version.** Quoting what it
    serves is correct and needs no version. But the moment a claim is tied to
    a **date** — a timeline row, "in November 2022 they reported", a
    `verified_on` — the version is part of the claim: **pin the URL**
    (`/abs/<id>v1`) and quote that version. `/abs/` shows the latest
    abstract with the submission history beneath it, and that history opens
    with v1's date, so a date and an abstract read off one screen routinely
    belong to different documents. That is the whole trap; it has caught two
    reviewers here.
  - Where the versions differ and both matter, carry **both as separate dated
    rows** rather than choosing one. `content/wiki/event/eliza.md` is the
    worked example.
  - **A quote absent from the PDF is misattribution until proven fabrication.**
    Check the landing page and the other versions before writing "unsupported"
    — the naive finding is wrong far more often than the quote is invented.
  - **Absence is never proven until you have ruled out your own instrument.**
    Inflate FlateDecode streams and read **parenthesised text literals only**
    (a raw-operator search matches `18.9` inside `/F318.9664Tf`); expect
    ligatures (`five`→`\002ve`, `final`→`\002nal`) and LaTeX escaping
    (`39.7\%`, `$1.96$%`). Search distinctive fragments that straddle
    neither. A number that lives only inside a chart image will never pass a
    substring search — record that, never "correct" it to a greppable wrong
    one. WebFetch's extractor both invents text and denies text that is
    present: its prose is not evidence in either direction.

## How to end (required)

End by writing a file named `RESULT.md` at the root of this worktree. Its
**first line** must be exactly one of:

- `done` — you attempted the outcome; the diff is your claim.
- `blocked: <one-line reason>` — the task could not be done honestly
  (missing information, an acceptance check that cannot be met, a forbidden
  action). This is a **successful** outcome, recorded as such. Reporting
  blocked is always better than producing something plausible.
- `capacity` — you observed your own provider's limit.

Everything after the first line is free-form notes; nothing reads them
mechanically. Write no other status anywhere: this file is the only channel.
If `RESULT.md` is absent or its first line is not one of the three forms, the
run is recorded as interrupted — the work is kept on the branch and resumed
later, and no retry is consumed.

## Relevant spec excerpts

These are the rules this work is judged against. They are excerpts targeted at
this job type (targeted; relevant material was omitted or cut — the full files are in this worktree at the paths named below, read them if you need the omitted or complete text).

 ### From `specs/wiki` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/wiki/spec.md`)

### Requirement: Feed binding joins on declared ids, never on names

A feed-bound fact is joined to its source row by an **explicitly declared
row id**, never by name matching — name matching is guessing, and this
design never guesses. Concretely:

- An entry that binds any fact to a feed SHALL declare, in a `feeds` map in
  its front matter, the row id it corresponds to in each source, using that
  source's own id field (for OpenRouter, the row's `id` such as
  `anthropic/claude-opus-5`; each source's registry entry names which field
  is its row id).
- Each feed-bound fact declares the source id and the field path within the
  joined row (dot notation, e.g. `pricing.prompt`).
- A feed row whose id is declared by no entry feeds the model catalog and
  the changed feed; it SHALL never modify any existing entry. For a source
  with a `mints` mapping it additionally mints a **new** stub record per
  the ingest-minting rule in `pulse` — creating a new record and touching
  an existing entry are different operations, and only the first is ever
  automatic.
- A declared row id that is absent from the current snapshot SHALL cause
  the fact to render its last-known value with a visible as-of date, and a
  repair finding enters the derived queue. It never renders as current.

**The worked example** — the complete front matter of one entry, normative
for field names and shapes (prose body follows the closing delimiter):

```yaml
id: model/claude-opus-5
kind: model
display_name: "Claude Opus 5"
status: active            # active | preview | announced | deprecated | retired | dead
maintenance: living       # living | stable | dormant
aliases:
  - name: "Claude Opus 5"
    class: exclusive
  - name: "Opus 5"
    class: shared
  - name: "Claude"
    class: manual
feeds:
  openrouter-models: "anthropic/claude-opus-5"   # this source's row id
facts:
  - field: price_input
    source: feed
    feed: openrouter-models
    path: pricing.prompt
    volatility: fast
  - field: context_window
    source: feed
    feed: openrouter-models
    path: context_length
    volatility: fast
  - field: release_date
    source: cited
    value: "2026-05-01"
    source_url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-5"
    accessed: "2026-08-27"
    volatility: dated
timeline:
  - date: "2026-05-01"
    event: released
    source_url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-5"
mentions: []
```

#### Scenario: A declared join updates the entry

- **WHEN** the snapshot row `anthropic/claude-opus-5` changes its
  `pricing.prompt` value
- **THEN** the entry above renders the new `price_input` at next build,
  because the join was declared — not inferred

#### Scenario: An undeclared row never modifies an existing entry

- **WHEN** a new row appears in a feed and no entry declares its id
- **THEN** it appears in the model catalog and (if material) the changed
  feed, no existing entry's facts change, and — only if the source
  declares a `mints` mapping — a new stub record is created per `pulse`

#### Scenario: A vanished row cannot pose as current

- **WHEN** an entry declares a row id that the latest snapshot no longer
  contains
- **THEN** the bound facts render their last-known values with a visible
  as-of date and a repair finding appears in the derived queue

### From `specs/editorial` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/editorial/spec.md`)

### Requirement: Every published prose piece must earn its reader

Before any prose piece (wiki entry body, education page, tutorial, blog
post) publishes, it MUST satisfy all three:

1. **It gives an enthusiast something.** At least one of: a thing they
   likely did not know; scattered things assembled in one place for the
   first time; a live, derived view no one else shows. A piece that a
   daily AI-follower would skim and learn nothing from has not earned
   publication.
2. **It is specific.** Dates, numbers, names, sources, mechanisms — never
   "many believe", "rapidly evolving", "in recent years". Every paragraph
   survives the question "what exactly is this telling me?"
3. **It would be worth a stranger's attention.** The judge is a stranger
   who does not know or care that an AI made this site; the novelty of the
   site's construction counts for nothing in this judgment. Two
   operational forms, and passing either satisfies this clause:
   - the **would-cite test**: a reasonable person arguing about this topic
     online could paste this URL as support — pages that answer a question
     completely pass; pages that gesture at a topic fail;
   - the **would-send test**: a reader who follows this topic would send
     this piece to a specific person with no more explanation than "look
     at this" — the test that selects stories, where would-cite selects
     references.
   A surface's own spec MAY require one form in particular (the blog
   requires would-send — see `blog`); this clause sets the floor, not the
   assignment.

*Dull, derivative, padded, obvious,* and *self-referential* are real defect
names, usable as-is in review. Rejecting a piece as boring requires no
disguise as a factual objection. **Correct, sourced, and forgettable is a
failure of this requirement, not a near miss**: a piece failing only clause
3 SHALL be treated exactly as one failing any other clause — being true and
checkable earns no publication by itself, and a scrupulously honest site
nobody visits is the named outcome this clause exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: Accurate but empty

- **WHEN** a draft post correctly summarizes an announcement every newsletter
  already covered, adding no assembly, no data, and no angle
- **THEN** it is rejected as `not-worth-reading` — accuracy alone does not
  publish

#### Scenario: The would-cite test in review

- **WHEN** a reviewer can articulate neither who would link the piece and in
  what argument, nor who would send it and to whom
- **THEN** that is sufficient grounds for a `not-worth-reading` rejection,
  recorded in those words

#### Scenario: Sendable carries a piece that citable would not

- **WHEN** a short dated piece is one nobody would paste as support in an
  argument, but any follower of its subject would send to a colleague it
  affects
- **THEN** clause 3 is satisfied by the would-send test and the piece is not
  rejected for failing would-cite alone

---

### From `specs/review` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/review/spec.md`)

### Requirement: What is checked depends on what the work is

The reviewer SHALL work from the checklist for the job's kind — reviewing a
wiki entry, a tutorial, and a machinery change are not the same job:

- **Wiki entry**: every cited fact has a reachable source and the source
  says what the fact says (fetch and confirm — do not assume); volatile
  values are transclusions or feed-bound, not literals; aliases sanely
  classed; prose adds something beyond the data.
- **Tutorial**: evidence the steps were actually executed (transcript or
  reproduced outputs) — plausibility is not verification; `subjects`,
  `verified_against`, `verified_on` complete and honest; unexecuted steps
  disclosed; perishables all declared.
- **Blog post**: every external claim source-checked by fetching; title and
  excerpt read against the body for overclaim; company-conduct claims held
  to the news-fact-checking standard; dates explicit. Additionally, the
  reviewer SHALL identify the post's form (news note or synthesis — see
  `blog`) and apply that form's finish line: for a note, the declared
  anchor holds (external anchors fetched and confirmed to document the
  event and its date), the affected party is named where one exists, and
  brevity alone is never a defect; for a synthesis, the derivation method
  is stated and the evidence enumerable. The reviewer SHALL judge the
  prose against the voice document `blog` names, rejecting
  `reads-as-generated` where it reads machine-made — the advisory voice
  lint's build warnings MAY be cited as evidence, but the judgment is the
  reviewer's, not the count's — and SHALL answer the
  send question in the record's `would-cite` field — who would send this,
  and to whom — in its own words.
- **Scout run**: the charge's failure condition applied first — a run
  whose candidates could all have been written without leaving the
  repository fails it; evidence URLs spot-checked by fetching; every
  candidate carries slug, type, `expires:`, why-now, retrieval-dated
  evidence, and done-when lines; every declined story has a drop record
  naming the failed test and a refile condition; at most three candidates
  filed.
- **Education page**: no perishable literals; prerequisites and the
  "after this you will understand" statement honest; beats the obvious
  alternative.
- **Directory/curated data**: spot-check changed rows against their sources.
- **Machinery change**: run the changed check or script and confirm the
  claimed behavior — red before, green after where applicable; every claim
  about what the change does verified by executing, not by reading; guard
  rails tested by attempting what they forbid.

For a job that originated from a proposal, the checklist additionally
includes the rejection index (`data/proposals/rejected/`): the reviewer
confirms the piece is not a differently-worded re-tread of a rejected
proposal — this is the judgment half of duplicate suppression, whose
mechanical half is the exact slug match in `loop`.

In every kind, the reviewer's standing instruction is: **for every claim
about what something does, run the cheap direct check; for every sourced
claim, confirm the source supports it.** The defect class this review exists
to catch is the claim written from intent rather than measurement — found
repeatedly by skeptical readers on the previous site and never once by an
automated check.

#### Scenario: The reviewer measures instead of reading

- **WHEN** a machinery diff claims "this makes X impossible"
- **THEN** the reviewer attempts X against the changed code and the verdict
  cites the attempt's observed result, not the diff's description

#### Scenario: A scout run is checked against its charge

- **WHEN** a scout run's diff arrives for review with three candidates and
  two drop records
- **THEN** the reviewer verifies the candidates carry externally retrieved,
  retrieval-dated evidence, spot-fetches it, and rejects the run as
  `spec-violation` if everything filed could have been written from the
  repository alone
