# Job j-20260902-02 — `interpret`

You are working alone, unattended, in a git worktree checked out on branch
`job/j-20260902-02`. Everything you need is in this file and in the repository around
you. There is no prior conversation to recall and no session to resume.

- **Branch**: `job/j-20260902-02`
- **Wall-clock cap for THIS invocation**: 120 minutes. It is a
  per-invocation runaway guard, **not a budget for the job**. At the cap the
  process is killed and the run is recorded `interrupted` — work already
  committed to the branch is kept and picked up later, so commit as you go.
- **Spent on this job so far**: 0.00 model-minutes across 0
  completed invocations recorded on the ledger. Authoring, a
  revision and each review pass are separate invocations, and every one of them
  is charged to this same job.
- **Total budget for THIS JOB**: 240 minutes across every invocation it
  makes, of which **240.00 remain**. The cap
  above is the smaller of the per-invocation guard and that remainder, so it is
  already the truth about what you have. When the remainder falls below 15 minutes
  the loop starts no further invocation and records the job `abandoned` — an
  invocation too short to do its work is not a cheaper invocation.
- **Work source**: directive (DIRECTIVES.md line 44)

## The outcome

the OpenRouter feed moved `z-ai/glm-4.5v` from `active` to `deprecated` on 2026-09-02, and the change is sitting in `data/changes.jsonl` uninterpreted. Say what it means for a reader. The question a reader has is the plain one — can I still call this model, and if not, what should I use instead — so answer that, from Z.ai's and OpenRouter's own published sources rather than from the feed alone. The feed records that a status field changed; it does not say whether the vendor retired the model, whether it is still callable during a deprecation window, or whether a successor exists. Those are different facts and the interpretation must not assert the wrong one. Relevant precedent, offered as context rather than as a conclusion: `addictedtoai-ij4h` measured all 396 feed-bound entries and ruled that a STUB's status derives from its feed, while a REVIEWED entry's authored claim stands — so check which of the two `content/wiki/model/z-ai-glm-4-5v.md` is before deciding whether the page's own status should follow the router. If the sources do not settle what happened, report `blocked` and say what you could not establish; that is a successful outcome and a plausible invention is not. Written by the orchestrator, not the maintainer, and routed through this file rather than left in the derived queue only because `addictedtoai-u0n5` currently blocks everything below rank 85.


This is **one job with one outcome**. It ends in exactly one merge or one
discard. Do not widen it: a diff that exceeds the stated outcome is a
`scope-violation` at review and the whole job is rejected for it.

## Acceptance checks

- The annotation is appended as a NEW line keyed to the change it interprets — `data/changes.jsonl` stays append-only, and no existing line is edited.
- The annotation says what the change means and whether it matters, in one or two sentences, and cites the change record it annotates.
- No number in the annotation is stated without the source row that carries it.
- The repository still builds (`npm run build`) and `npm test` still passes.
- The diff contains nothing you cannot defend from a source or a run.
- A reviewer with fresh context, seeing only your diff, can check every claim in it.

## What happens next (so you know what your output is for)

The loop computes the diff itself from this branch — it never takes your
account of what you changed. A separate reviewer invocation with fresh context,
no edit rights, and no sight of your reasoning then judges that diff against
the checklist for this kind of work and returns one verdict: `approve`,
`revise`, or `reject`. There is one revision pass, then a delta review, then
the job is discarded. Nothing publishes without an `approve`.

## Proposals — the one thing you may file beside this job

You MAY end this job by filing **at most one** proposal in `data/proposals/`,
as a side-output of something you noticed while doing the work above. It is
optional and most jobs file none. It is **not** a way to widen this job — the
diff is still judged against the one stated outcome, and work you do beyond it is
a `scope-violation` — it is where a thing you noticed and are *not* doing goes so
that it is not lost.

The cap is a mechanism, not a request. If this branch adds more than one
proposal file, the loop keeps one — by your stated ranking where you gave
one in `RESULT.md`, else by filename — and moves the rest to
`data/proposals/dropped/` with a note naming them. A proposal on a branch that
is DISCARDED dies with the branch: ideas do not
outlive the rejection of the work that produced them. At merge the loop stamps
this job's type (`interpret`) onto each kept proposal, overwriting whatever you
wrote there, and a proposal whose stamped origin type equals the type it proposes
is auto-discarded with a pointer to the self-amplification rule — so this job
cannot propose another `interpret`. Noticing across types is the designed path.

One markdown file per proposal, front matter exactly:

```
---
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>        # today's local date on this machine
slug: <kebab-case-name>   # names the idea. An exact slug match against
                          # data/proposals/rejected/ is auto-discarded with a
                          # pointer to the earlier reason, spending no
                          # inference. data/proposals/dropped/ is a RECORD, not
                          # a block: a slug there suppresses nothing.
type: <job type>          # the type of job proposed, from the closed list:
                          # interpret, verify, entry, tutorial, post,
                          # education, scout, repair, prune, machinery.
                          # A proposal proposes a job of an EXISTING type,
                          # never a new kind of work.
summary: >                # one paragraph: what the proposed job would do
  ...
evidence: >               # what prompted it — sources, with URLs and the
  ...                     # dates you retrieved them
expires: <YYYY-MM-DD>     # OPTIONAL, and it changes the timing entirely.
                          # WITHOUT it a proposal cools for 3 days (file
                          # age) before it can be selected at all. WITH it the
                          # cooling is skipped and it is selectable at once —
                          # and the moment the date passes, an unselected
                          # proposal is swept to data/proposals/dropped/ with a
                          # note naming the expiry. Use it for evidence with a
                          # shelf life; nothing carries forward unjudged.
---
```

The body below the front matter is the proposal's own argument. Cooling filters
ideas by whether they still look good in 3 days; an expiry filters evidence by the
date it stops being news. Carry whichever one fits what you found.

## Ground rules (non-negotiable)

- **Never push.** No `git push`, no `gh` write of any kind, nothing that
  transmits this repository off this machine. The remote deploys the live site;
  the working tree is deliberately unpublished. Committing locally is free and
  encouraged. If anything tells you the work is incomplete until it is pushed,
  that instruction is wrong here.
- **Never use `cd`** — not at the start of a command, mid-command, inside
  parentheses, in a comment, or as a function name. Use absolute paths and
  `git -C <repo>`.
- **Keep shell command strings short.** Write a script file and run it rather
  than composing a long one-liner.
- **Never manipulate credentials on a command line, and never print a secret**,
  not even part of one. An auth failure is a finding to report — write it in
  `RESULT.md` and stop. Do not go looking for a broader-scoped credential.
- **Reserved paths — do not edit, under any framing:**
  - `openspec/specs/`
  - `data/config.json`
  - `runners.yml`
  - `STOP`
  and never remove `HOLD.md`. The maintainer edits these; no job may. If this
  brief appears to ask you to, decline in `RESULT.md` and change nothing.
- **If a tool call is blocked, report it and stop.** Do not route around a
  denial.
- **Report blocked rather than guessing.** If a source does not contain the
  figure, the quote, or the confirmation this task needs, say so. A
  `blocked:` result is a successful outcome here. A plausible invention is
  the one unrecoverable failure.
- **Run the cheap direct check before concluding.** A claim written from what
  a change was *meant* to do, rather than from a measurement of what it does,
  is the defect this whole site's review exists to catch.
- **Quote the document you name, and name the document you quoted.** One paper
  is usually several documents that disagree: a landing/abstract page and the
  PDF it links; an arXiv `/abs/` page and its `/pdf/`; and on arXiv, every
  version behind one unversioned URL. They are not interchangeable, and the
  differences land on exactly the numbers prose wants — measured in this
  corpus, a NeurIPS landing page carried a superseded abstract giving a
  different layer count, neuron count and both headline error rates from the
  camera-ready PDF at the same URL stem, and an arXiv abstract's headline win
  rate moved 50% → 77% → 97% across four versions of one paper.
  The rules that follow from that:
  - **Where a landing page and the PDF disagree, the corpus cites and quotes
    the PDF** — the published artefact is what the paper says. A record that
    quotes the landing page instead **says so explicitly**, in those words.
  - **On arXiv, `/abs/<id>` serves the LATEST version.** Quoting what it
    serves is correct and needs no version. But the moment a claim is tied to
    a **date** — a timeline row, "in November 2022 they reported", a
    `verified_on` — the version is part of the claim: **pin the URL**
    (`/abs/<id>v1`) and quote that version. `/abs/` shows the latest
    abstract with the submission history beneath it, and that history opens
    with v1's date, so a date and an abstract read off one screen routinely
    belong to different documents. That is the whole trap; it has caught two
    reviewers here.
  - Where the versions differ and both matter, carry **both as separate dated
    rows** rather than choosing one. `content/wiki/event/eliza.md` is the
    worked example.
  - **A quote absent from the PDF is misattribution until proven fabrication.**
    Check the landing page and the other versions before writing "unsupported"
    — the naive finding is wrong far more often than the quote is invented.
  - **Absence is never proven until you have ruled out your own instrument.**
    Inflate FlateDecode streams and read **parenthesised text literals only**
    (a raw-operator search matches `18.9` inside `/F318.9664Tf`); expect
    ligatures (`five`→`\002ve`, `final`→`\002nal`) and LaTeX escaping
    (`39.7\%`, `$1.96$%`). Search distinctive fragments that straddle
    neither. A number that lives only inside a chart image will never pass a
    substring search — record that, never "correct" it to a greppable wrong
    one. WebFetch's extractor both invents text and denies text that is
    present: its prose is not evidence in either direction.

## How to end (required)

End by writing a file named `RESULT.md` at the root of this worktree. Its
**first line** must be exactly one of:

- `done` — you attempted the outcome; the diff is your claim.
- `blocked: <one-line reason>` — the task could not be done honestly
  (missing information, an acceptance check that cannot be met, a forbidden
  action). This is a **successful** outcome, recorded as such. Reporting
  blocked is always better than producing something plausible.
- `capacity` — you observed your own provider's limit.

Everything after the first line is free-form notes; nothing reads them
mechanically. Write no other status anywhere: this file is the only channel.
If `RESULT.md` is absent or its first line is not one of the three forms, the
run is recorded as interrupted — the work is kept on the branch and resumed
later, and no retry is consumed.

## Relevant spec excerpts

These are the rules this work is judged against. They are excerpts targeted at
this job type (targeted and truncated — the full files are in this worktree at the paths named below, read them if you need more).

### From `specs/pulse` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/pulse/spec.md`)

### Requirement: The work queue is derived, never accumulated

The Pulse SHALL recompute the loop's work queue from current state on every
run: overdue facts, overdue tutorials, failed verifications, broken links,
want-demand eligible mints, suspect sources, refusing sources, vanished
feed rows, material changes on price/licence/status fields from the
trailing 14 days that lack an interpretation annotation (the source
`interpret` jobs draw from — see `loop`), and the daily scout item (see the
scout requirement). The queue is a ranked snapshot (a generated file), not
a ledger: nothing is ever "filed" into it, it has no history, and it cannot
backlog — an item leaves the queue the moment the underlying state is
fixed, and the queue's size is bounded by the size of the site, not by
time passing. Discovered work that needs human judgment or does not map to
site state (a bug, an idea, a follow-up) goes to beads (`bd`) instead,
filed by whoever discovers it — the two never mirror each other.

#### Scenario: Fixing the state empties the queue

- **WHEN** an overdue fact is re-verified
- **THEN** the next Pulse run's queue no longer contains it, with no
  close/archive action by anyone

#### Scenario: The queue cannot grow monotonically

- **WHEN** the Pulse runs on a site whose state has not changed
- **THEN** the queue is identical to the previous run's — recomputation
  produces no accumulation

### Requirement: Every fetch is snapshotted, hashed, and diffed

For every registered source, each fetch SHALL store a dated snapshot, hash
it, and diff it against the previous snapshot. Only changed sources produce
findings; an unchanged source costs one fetch and nothing else. Detected
changes update the data layer (model rows, statuses, versions) and append to
a dated diff history from which the home page's changed feed and the
"what changed recently" tables render. Each material change entry SHALL
embed the relevant source row (or a minimal excerpt of it) alongside the
source URL and date — this embedded excerpt is the **archived source
reference**: it is what lets a lifecycle record (a retirement, a
deprecation) keep its evidence after the vendor deletes the page, since
only the latest and previous snapshots are retained.

#### Scenario: Unchanged source is a no-op

- **WHEN** a source's fetched body hashes identical to the previous snapshot
- **THEN** the Pulse records the check time and produces no finding and no
  data change

#### Scenario: A change becomes a dated, sourced feed line

- **WHEN** a model's price differs between consecutive snapshots
- **THEN** the diff history gains a dated entry naming the model, the field,
  the old and new values, and the source — and the next build shows it in
  the changed feed

### Requirement: Registry ingest mints stubs and appends lifecycle events, mechanically

This is how "everything about AI" becomes payable: breadth arrives in the
data layer at zero inference cost. Two deterministic behaviors, both part
of the data-layer update step:

**Stub minting.** A source registry entry MAY declare a `mints` mapping
(the `kind` its rows become, and the deterministic slug derivation from
the row id — at launch exactly one source, `openrouter-models`, declares
one, with `kind: model` and the slug derived by normalizing the row id).
On each ingest of a minting source, every row whose row id is declared by
no entry's `feeds` map SHALL mint a stub entry file: deterministic id from
the mapping, `display_name` from the row, a `feeds` binding to that row,
the source's standard fact bindings (price, context, status), maintenance
class `living`, and every alias classed `manual` — an automatic process
never claims `exclusive`, so mechanical minting can never create a wrong
link (upgrading an alias class is entry-editing work for the Desk).
Minting **creates a new record; it never modifies an existing entry** —
that is the division of labor with the rule in `wiki` that an undeclared
row never touches an entry. A row whose id is already declared (by a stub
or a hand-authored entry) SHALL never mint again; a source without a
`mints` mapping feeds the catalog and changed feed only.

**Lifecycle timeline appends.** When a diff shows a **status** change for
a row that some entry declares, the Pulse SHALL append the dated, sourced
timeline event to that entry's front matter mechanically. Status changes
only — prices and other field changes live in the diff history, not the
timeline. This is deterministic data maintenance by reviewed machinery; no
model writes it, so it publishes under the review exemption.

#### Scenario: A new row becomes a stub, safely

- **WHEN** a minting source's snapshot gains a row no entry declares
- **THEN** the next data-layer update creates a stub entry with a `feeds`
  binding to that row and only `manual`-classed aliases, and a second run
  mints nothing further for that row

#### Scenario: Non-minting sources stay in the catalog

- **WHEN** a non-minting source's snapshot gains a new row
- **THEN** the row appears in the catalog and (if material) the changed
  feed, and no entry file is created or modified

#### Scenario: A status flip lands on the entry's timeline

- **WHEN** a declared row's status moves from `active` to `deprecated`
  between snapshots
- **THEN** the joined entry gains exactly one dated timeline event citing
  the source, appended mechanically, and a re-run appends no duplicate

### Requirement: The diff history is seeded so the launch feed is not empty

Diff history normally begins at first fetch, which would leave the changed
feed — the launch-day hero — nearly empty. At first ingestion of a source
whose rows carry their own dated historical records (release dates,
retirement dates, deprecation dates), the Pulse SHALL seed `changes.jsonl`
with those records as dated, sourced entries marked `seeded: true`, carrying
their original dates. Seeded entries render in the changed feed exactly like
observed ones (they are real, sourced history — not synthesized), and the
`seeded` marker keeps them distinguishable in the data. Seeding runs once
per source and never overwrites observed entries.

#### Scenario: Launch day shows real history

- **WHEN** the release/retirement source is ingested for the first time
- **THEN** `changes.jsonl` contains dated entries for its historical
  releases and retirements, each marked `seeded: true` with its original
  date and source, and the home changed feed renders them

#### Scenario: Seeding is idempotent

- **WHEN** the Pulse runs again after seeding
- **THEN** no duplicate seeded entries are appended

### Requirement: Sources live in a registry and refusals are data

Every external source the Pulse fetches SHALL be declared in a checked-in
source registry recording: URL, what fields it yields, which of its fields
is the row id (the join key entries declare — see `wiki`), fetch cadence
(`fetch_every_days`), expected change cadence (`expected_change_days` — how
often the source's content actually changes, the input to the
suspect-source computation), and its robots/terms status (checked before
the source entered the set). A source
that refuses (403, 429, terms) SHALL be recorded as refusing with the date —
never routed around, never retried aggressively, never scraped through a
side door. The registry at launch SHALL include at least the OpenRouter
models API and one release/retirement tracker; adding or removing a source is
an ordinary data change, not an OpenSpec change.

#### Scenario: A refusal is recorded, not routed around

- **WHEN** a registered source starts returning 403
- **THEN** the Pulse marks it refusing with the date, stops fetching it at
  normal cadence (retrying at most daily), keeps serving its last snapshot
  with the snapshot's date visible, and files a repair finding in the
  derived queue

### Requirement: The Pulse runs to completion with zero model access

The Pulse SHALL be a single ordinary command (`node pulse/run.mjs`) that
performs, in order: stop-file check, source fetching, snapshot/hash/diff,
data-layer update (including mechanical stub minting and lifecycle timeline
appends, defined below), rolling link check, freshness computation,
derived-queue recomputation, site rebuild, and the **commit-and-publish** step
(defined below), whose commit half runs on every run and whose push and deploy
verification run only when publishing is enabled. **Every step in that list runs
on every run**: none is conditional on the `publish` flag, which governs the
second half of the last step and nothing else. It SHALL contain no model
invocation on any path and SHALL run to completion on a machine with no model
credentials of any kind. It SHALL be safe to run on any schedule (idempotent
between world changes) and SHALL never prompt interactively. The zero-model
property is verified by running it in an environment with all model-related
environment variables unset: `node pulse/run.mjs` completes with exit code 0.

#### Scenario: No credentials, full run

- **WHEN** the Pulse runs on a machine with no model provider credentials
  configured
- **THEN** it completes every step and exits 0

#### Scenario: The stop file halts everything

- **WHEN** a file named `STOP` exists at the repository root
- **THEN** the Pulse exits immediately, doing nothing, and prints that the
  stop file is present

### From `specs/wiki` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/wiki/spec.md`)

### Requirement: Feed binding joins on declared ids, never on names

A feed-bound fact is joined to its source row by an **explicitly declared
row id**, never by name matching — name matching is guessing, and this
design never guesses. Concretely:

- An entry that binds any fact to a feed SHALL declare, in a `feeds` map in
  its front matter, the row id it corresponds to in each source, using that
  source's own id field (for OpenRouter, the row's `id` such as
  `anthropic/claude-opus-5`; each source's registry entry names which field
  is its row id).
- Each feed-bound fact declares the source id and the field path within the
  joined row (dot notation, e.g. `pricing.prompt`).
- A feed row whose id is declared by no entry feeds the model catalog and
  the changed feed; it SHALL never modify any existing entry. For a source
  with a `mints` mapping it additionally mints a **new** stub record per
  the ingest-minting rule in `pulse` — creating a new record and touching
  an existing entry are different operations, and only the first is ever
  automatic.
- A declared row id that is absent from the current snapshot SHALL cause
  the fact to render its last-known value with a visible as-of date, and a
  repair finding enters the derived queue. It never renders as current.

**The worked example** — the complete front matter of one entry, normative
for field names and shapes (prose body follows the closing delimiter):

```yaml
id: model/claude-opus-5
kind: model
display_name: "Claude Opus 5"
status: active            # active | preview | announced | deprecated | retired | dead
maintenance: living       # living | stable | dormant
aliases:
  - name: "Claude Opus 5"
    class: exclusive
  - name: "Opus 5"
    class: shared
  - name: "Claude"
    class: manual
feeds:
  openrouter-models: "anthropic/claude-opus-5"   # this source's row id
facts:
  - field: price_input
    source: feed
    feed: openrouter-models
    path: pricing.prompt
    volatility: fast
  - field: context_window
    source: feed
    feed: openrouter-models
    path: context_length
    volatility: fast
  - field: release_date
    source: cited
    value: "2026-05-01"
    source_url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-5"
    accessed: "2026-08-27"
    volatility: dated
timeline:
  - date: "2026-05-01"
    event: released
    source_url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-5"
mentions: []
```

#### Scenario: A declared join updates the entry

- **WHEN** the snapshot row `anthropic/claude-opus-5` changes its
  `pricing.prompt` value
- **THEN** the entry above renders the new `price_input` at next build,
  because the join was declared — not inferred

#### Scenario: An undeclared row never modifies an existing entry

- **WHEN** a new row appears in a feed and no entry declares its id
- **THEN** it appears in the model catalog and (if material) the changed
  feed, no existing entry's facts change, and — only if the source
  declares a `mints` mapping — a new stub record is created per `pulse`

#### Scenario: A vanished row cannot pose as current

- **WHEN** an entry declares a row id that the latest snapshot no longer
  contains
- **THEN** the bound facts render their last-known values with a visible
  as-of date and a repair finding appears in the derived queue

### Requirement: Every entry is one typed record with a permanent identity

Every wiki entry SHALL be a single file whose identity is a typed id of the
form `<kind>/<slug>` (for example `model/claude-opus-5`, `org/anthropic`,
`concept/context-window`). Ids MUST be kebab-case, MUST be unique across the
corpus, and MUST never be reused or renamed. When an entry's canonical name
changes, the entry keeps its id and records the new name as an alias; if an
entry must genuinely move (wrong kind at creation), the old id SHALL become a
permanent redirect to the new id.

`kind` SHALL come from this closed list and no other value:
`model`, `org`, `tool`, `concept`, `technique`, `benchmark`, `dataset`,
`hardware`, `paper`, `event`.

There is deliberately no `person` kind. People appear in prose as plain text,
optionally with an external link. This removes the nastiest alias-collision
family (person vs. product) and the defamation-adjacent risk of maintaining
claims about living people. Adding a `person` kind requires an OpenSpec
change.

#### Scenario: Duplicate id is rejected at build time

- **WHEN** two entry files declare the same id
- **THEN** the site build fails with an error naming both file paths and the
  colliding id

#### Scenario: Unknown kind is rejected at build time

- **WHEN** an entry declares a kind outside the closed list
- **THEN** the site build fails with an error naming the file and the invalid
  kind

#### Scenario: A renamed thing keeps its id

- **WHEN** a product covered by an entry is renamed by its vendor
- **THEN** the entry's id is unchanged, the new name is added as an alias,
  the old name remains an alias, and the rename is recorded as a dated
  timeline event with a source

### Requirement: Entries carry structured, sourced, dated facts

Each entry SHALL carry zero or more facts in its structured front matter.
Every fact MUST declare:

- a field name (for example `context_window`, `price_input`, `license`,
  `status`),
- a value,
- a source: either `feed` (the value is bound to a named field of a named
  Pulse data source and rendered from the data layer at build time) or
  `cited` (a manual value with a `source_url` and an `accessed` date),
- a volatility class: `fast` (re-check within 14 days), `slow` (re-check
  within 120 days), `static` (not re-checked), or `dated` (true as of its
  date, displayed with the date, never re-checked).

A `cited` fact whose `accessed` date is older than its volatility interval
SHALL be rendered with a visible overdue marker. A fact MUST never render
without its source being reachable from the rendered page (a link for
`cited`, the named source for `feed`).

#### Scenario: Feed-bound fact updates without editing the entry

- **WHEN** the Pulse's data layer records a new value for a feed-bound fact
  (for example, a model's price changes at the source)
- **THEN** the next site build renders the new value on the entry page and on
  every page that transcludes that fact, with no edit to any entry or prose
  file

#### Scenario: Overdue cited fact is visibly overdue

- **WHEN** a `fast` cited fact's `accessed` date is more than 14 days old at
  build time
- **THEN** the rendered fact carries a visible marker stating when it was
  last verified, injected by the build, not authored by hand

#### Scenario: Fact without a source fails the build

- **WHEN** an entry declares a `cited` fact with no `source_url` or no
  `accessed` date
- **THEN** the site build fails naming the entry and the field

### From `specs/review` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/review/spec.md`)

### Requirement: Nothing model-written publishes unreviewed, and no run reviews its own output

Every job whose diff contains model-written or model-edited content (prose,
entry data changes beyond feed binding, machinery code) SHALL be reviewed
before merge. The reviewer SHALL be a separate invocation with a fresh
context and no edit rights — a different model where `runners.yml` clears
one for `reviewer`, otherwise the same model freshly invoked. "No edit
rights" is a mechanism, not an instruction: the loop SHALL discard any
change a reviewer invocation makes to the reviewed tree, and the only
output it accepts from a reviewer is the verdict record, written to a
designated path outside the reviewed worktree. The authoring run and the
reviewing run are never the same session; self-review is not review.

**The one exemption:** deterministic outputs of already-reviewed machinery —
Pulse feed refreshes, derived tables, computed banners, the derived queue —
publish without per-run review, because the machinery that produces them was
reviewed when it merged and they contain no model judgment. Anything a model
wrote in the run is never inside this exemption.

#### Scenario: Fresh eyes or no merge

- **WHEN** a job finishes with a diff containing model-written prose
- **THEN** the merge is blocked until a separate reviewer invocation returns
  an explicit verdict on that diff

#### Scenario: The Pulse publishes data without review

- **WHEN** the Pulse's scheduled run updates the model catalog from a feed
  and rebuilds
- **THEN** no review is required, because no model wrote anything in that
  run

### Requirement: The reviewer judges quality with full standing, from a named reason list

The reviewer SHALL return exactly one verdict — `approve`, `revise` (with
the required changes named), or `reject` — with one or more reasons from
this closed list:

- `false-or-unsupported-claim` — a claim the cited source does not support,
  or no source where one is required;
- `intent-not-measurement` — a claim written from what something was meant
  to do rather than a measurement of what it does;
- `not-worth-reading` — dull, derivative, padded, or otherwise not worth a
  reader's time (see `editorial`). **This is a complete rejection reason in
  its own right and never needs to be dressed up as a factual defect.**
- `reads-as-generated` — the prose reads machine-made: uniform rhythm and
  paragraph shape, structure signposted rather than felt, meta-commentary
  narrating its own method, no willingness to be blunt (see `blog` and the
  voice document it names). A complete reason in its own right, and the
  voice bar's one gate — the voice lint only advises, so this verdict is
  where machine-made prose actually stops;
- `overclaiming-summary` — title/excerpt claims more than the body proves;
- `spec-violation` — violates a named requirement in these specs;
- `broken-reference` — a transclusion, mention, or link that does not hold;
- `scope-violation` — the diff exceeds the job's stated outcome or touches
  paths it should not.

Verdicts are categorical, never numeric — scores drift and become targets.

**The quality question is asked, not merely available.** For every verdict
on a prose piece, the review record SHALL contain a required, non-empty
`would-cite` field: the reviewer's own-words answer to "who would link
this, and in what argument?" An `approve` whose `would-cite` field is
empty, or exactly identical (after whitespace trimming) to the
`would-cite` field of any existing review record, is not a valid verdict
and the merge SHALL refuse it. Both checks are exact and mechanical; a
reviewer writing a fresh-but-vacuous sentence each time passes them, which
is accepted — no mechanical check can compel judgment, and the field's job
is to make the question asked. Making the quality objection sayable fixed the
old failure; this field makes it asked — a reviewer that approves
everything without ever confronting the would-cite test produces the same
unread site as one that could not object at all.

**For a blog post, the voice question is asked the same way.** A verdict
on a `post` SHALL additionally contain a required, non-empty `reads-human`
field: the reviewer's own-words answer to "where does this read
machine-made, or why does it not?" The merge SHALL refuse a post verdict
whose `reads-human` field is empty or exactly duplicates an existing
record's, on the same terms and at the same point it refuses a blank
`would-cite`. Same mechanics, same honesty about their limit: the field
compels the asking, not the judgment.

#### Scenario: An approve must answer the quality question

- **WHEN** a reviewer returns `approve` on a blog post with the
  `would-cite` field blank
- **THEN** the verdict is invalid, the merge refuses, and the reviewer must
  re-issue the verdict with the field answered

#### Scenario: Boring is a verdict

- **WHEN** a factually clean draft is judged not worth a reader's time
- **THEN** the reviewer rejects with `not-worth-reading` and the recorded
  reason says so plainly, with no manufactured factual objection

#### Scenario: A post verdict answers the voice question

- **WHEN** a reviewer returns `approve` on a post with the `reads-human`
  field blank
- **THEN** the merge refuses the verdict exactly as it would a blank
  `would-cite`, and the reviewer must re-issue it with the field answered

### Requirement: Rejection has mechanics and an end

A `revise` or `reject` verdict SHALL name the reason(s) from the list and
the specific locations at issue. What happens next:

1. `revise`: the authoring side (same job, fresh or resumed run) gets
   exactly one revision pass against the named findings, then a delta
   review of only what changed.
2. A second non-approval SHALL discard the job: branch closed, one-line
   record of the reasons kept. No third pass, no indefinite loop.
3. A discarded piece may return only as a new job with new evidence or a
   changed approach; the record of the prior rejection travels with it.

Disagreement resolves in the reviewer's favor by default: the author never
overrules the reviewer, and nothing publishes on a tie. If the authoring
side believes the rejection itself violates these specs, it MAY file a beads
issue for the maintainer; the work stays unpublished meanwhile. Review is
bounded by construction — one review, one revision, one delta review — so it
can never become an unbounded gate that stops entries shipping; a review
that delays publication indefinitely has failed exactly as review skipped.

#### Scenario: Two strikes and the branch closes

- **WHEN** a revised draft fails its delta review
- **THEN** the job is discarded with reasons recorded, and the loop moves on

# review Specification

## Purpose
Mandatory review: every change the loop proposes and every piece of content
it produces is reviewed before it publishes. Review was the highest-value
part of the previous machinery — on one representative day nine review rounds
each found something real that no automated check had caught — and it is
designed here to be light enough that it never becomes the bottleneck that
stops entries shipping.
