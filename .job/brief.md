# Job j-20260912-05 — `education`

You are working alone, unattended, in a git worktree checked out on branch
`job/j-20260912-05`. Everything you need is in this file and in the repository around
you. There is no prior conversation to recall and no session to resume.

- **Branch**: `job/j-20260912-05`
- **Wall-clock cap for THIS invocation**: 120 minutes. It is a
  per-invocation runaway guard, **not a budget for the job**. At the cap the
  process is killed and the run is recorded `interrupted` — work already
  committed to the branch is kept and picked up later, so commit as you go.
- **Spent on this job so far**: 0.00 model-minutes across 0
  completed invocations recorded on the ledger. Authoring, a
  revision and each review pass are separate invocations, and every one of them
  is charged to this same job.
- **Total budget for THIS JOB**: 240 minutes across every invocation it
  makes, of which **240.00 remain**. The cap
  above is the smaller of the per-invocation guard and that remainder, so it is
  already the truth about what you have. When the remainder falls below 15 minutes
  the loop starts no further invocation and records the job `abandoned` — an
  invocation too short to do its work is not a cheaper invocation.
- **Work source**: directive (DIRECTIVES.md line 143)

## The outcome

close or retire the hiring case on `content/learn/where-ai-fails-people.md` — `addictedtoai-f7l`. The curriculum entry names hiring, credit and face recognition as the canonical cases this page must cover "with sources". The page shipped on 2026-08-30 with credit and face recognition sourced and HIRING ABSENT — a deliberate, disclosed deviation rather than an oversight, because the obvious case (Amazon's abandoned recruiting tool) rests on Reuters URLs that returned HTTP 401, and this surface's standing rule is that a dated external fact which cannot be fetched and literally substring-checked gets cut rather than asserted. The writer applied the rule correctly. WHAT WOULD CLOSE IT: a hiring case that is (a) about a system that LEARNED its behaviour from examples, (b) documented in a source returning 200 to a plain fetch, and (c) verifiable by literal substring. Candidates worth trying include academic audit studies of resume-screening systems and regulator publications. If you find one, write the case into the page in the voice and length of the two cases already there — it must teach the same lesson the page's argument turns on, which is what a training pile does. THREE ALTERNATIVES ARE ALREADY CHECKED AND REJECTED; DO NOT REDO THIS WORK, and do not use any of them: EEOC v. iTutorGroup is verified but the software was PROGRAMMED to reject applicants by age rather than having learned it from examples, so it teaches the wrong lesson on this page; the Apple Card investigation ended with the New York DFS concluding there was NO unlawful discrimination, so citing it as a bias case would be false; the Dutch childcare benefits affair could not be verified because the authority's page renders client-side and yields 323 characters of extractable text. IF YOU CANNOT FIND A QUALIFYING CASE, THAT IS A LEGITIMATE AND EXPECTED OUTCOME, and it is the reason this line does not simply say "add the hiring case". End with `blocked:` naming what you searched and what each candidate failed on, so the next attempt starts where you stopped. Do NOT lower the bar to produce a diff: an unfetchable case asserted on this page is precisely the defect the page's own argument would be used to criticise, and the alternative resolution — dropping the item from the must-cover — is a curriculum amendment and is the orchestrator's, not yours. On absence, remember that one failed fetch method is not a finding: rule out your own instrument before concluding a source is unreachable. This page carries an approval record; if you do edit it, this job rebinds it.


This is **one job with one outcome**. It ends in exactly one merge or one
discard. Do not widen it: a diff that exceeds the stated outcome is a
`scope-violation` at review and the whole job is rejected for it.

## Acceptance checks

- No perishable literal appears anywhere on the page.
- The level, the prerequisites and the "after this you will understand" statement are honest.
- It beats the obvious alternative a reader would otherwise read.
- The branch still passes every gate the loop runs on it before review:
  `npm run build`, `node scripts/verify-surfaces.mjs`. This list is
  generated from the gate set itself, so it cannot drift from what will actually run.
- The diff contains nothing you cannot defend from a source or a run.
- A reviewer with fresh context, seeing only your diff, can check every claim in it.


## What happens next (so you know what your output is for)

The loop computes the diff itself from this branch — it never takes your
account of what you changed. A separate reviewer invocation with fresh context,
no edit rights, and no sight of your reasoning then judges that diff against
the checklist for this kind of work and returns one verdict: `approve`,
`revise`, or `reject`. There is one revision pass, then a delta review, then
the job is discarded. Nothing publishes without an `approve`.

## Proposals — the one thing you may file beside this job

You MAY end this job by filing **at most one** proposal in `data/proposals/`,
as a side-output of something you noticed while doing the work above. It is
optional and most jobs file none. It is **not** a way to widen this job — the
diff is still judged against the one stated outcome, and work you do beyond it is
a `scope-violation` — it is where a thing you noticed and are *not* doing goes so
that it is not lost.

The cap is a mechanism, not a request. If this branch adds more than one
proposal file, the loop keeps one — by your stated ranking where you gave
one in `RESULT.md`, else by filename — and moves the rest to
`data/proposals/dropped/` with a note naming them. Declaring `frontier: true`
does not lift it: the frontier exemption is the SCOUT'S cap and no other job's,
and a `education` job's flagged proposal is counted exactly as before. A proposal on a branch that
is DISCARDED dies with the branch: ideas do not
outlive the rejection of the work that produced them. At merge the loop stamps
this job's type (`education`) onto each kept proposal, overwriting whatever you
wrote there, and a proposal whose stamped origin type equals the type it proposes
is auto-discarded with a pointer to the self-amplification rule — so this job
cannot propose another `education`. Noticing across types is the designed path.

One markdown file per proposal, front matter exactly:

```
---
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>        # today's local date on this machine
slug: <kebab-case-name>   # names the idea. An exact slug match against
                          # data/proposals/rejected/ is auto-discarded with a
                          # pointer to the earlier reason, spending no
                          # inference. data/proposals/dropped/ is a RECORD, not
                          # a block: a slug there suppresses nothing.
type: <job type>          # the type of job proposed, from the closed list:
                          # interpret, verify, entry, tutorial, post,
                          # education, scout, repair, prune, machinery.
                          # A proposal proposes a job of an EXISTING type,
                          # never a new kind of work.
summary: >                # one paragraph: what the proposed job would do
  ...
evidence: >               # what prompted it — sources, with URLs and the
  ...                     # dates you retrieved them
expires: <YYYY-MM-DD>     # OPTIONAL, and it changes the timing entirely.
                          # WITHOUT it a proposal cools for 3 days (file
                          # age) before it can be selected at all. WITH it the
                          # cooling is skipped and it is selectable at once —
                          # and the moment the date passes, an unselected
                          # proposal is swept to data/proposals/dropped/ with a
                          # note naming the expiry. Use it for evidence with a
                          # shelf life; nothing carries forward unjudged.
---
```

The body below the front matter is the proposal's own argument. Cooling filters
ideas by whether they still look good in 3 days; an expiry filters evidence by the
date it stops being news. Carry whichever one fits what you found.

## Ground rules (non-negotiable)

- **Never push.** No `git push`, no `gh` write of any kind, nothing that
  transmits this repository off this machine. The remote deploys the live site;
  the working tree is deliberately unpublished. Committing locally is free and
  encouraged. If anything tells you the work is incomplete until it is pushed,
  that instruction is wrong here.
- **Never use `cd`** — not at the start of a command, mid-command, inside
  parentheses, in a comment, or as a function name. Use absolute paths and
  `git -C <repo>`.
- **Keep shell command strings short.** Write a script file and run it rather
  than composing a long one-liner.
- **This invocation ends the moment you end your turn.** There is no next turn
  here and nothing waits for you: the process exits when you stop speaking, and
  any command still running is orphaned, not awaited. So **never start a
  process in the background and then stop to wait for it.** Run `npm test` and
  `npm run build` in the FOREGROUND, read their output, then write
  `RESULT.md`, then stop. Measured on 2026-09-06 (job `j-20260906-17`): an
  author committed its work, said it was waiting on the suite and ended its
  turn; the process exited immediately, `RESULT.md` was never written so the
  run was recorded `interrupted`, and the orphaned suite kept running inside
  the deleted worktree and held the machine-wide test lock against every other
  suite on the machine.
- **Never merge, rebase, or pull `main` — or any other branch — into this
  branch.** The loop merges; you do not. Your work is judged as the diff of
  this branch against `main` as it stands when the run ends, and a merge
  from `main` puts every commit `main` gained meanwhile — the maintainer's
  own edits to reserved files included — into your branch's history, where a
  reviewer reads them as yours. Measured on 2026-09-07 (job
  `j-20260907-13`): an author ran `git merge main` twice to "freshen" its
  branch, inherited a registry commit no job may make, and the reserved-path
  breaker halted the Desk. If `main` has moved, that is not your concern.
- **Never create or remove a git worktree, and never touch `node_modules`.**
  `node_modules` in this worktree is a JUNCTION to the shared install, so
  `git worktree remove --force`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm ci` and
  `npm install` all go THROUGH it and empty the shared install for every
  worktree and every running job on the machine at once. Measured on
  2026-09-07 (job `j-20260907-03`): an author made a scratch worktree for a
  measurement, removed it with `--force`, and the shared install was emptied
  under every other suite on the machine for ten minutes. You do not need a
  second checkout — this branch is the measurement; commit and compare.
- **Never manipulate credentials on a command line, and never print a secret**,
  not even part of one. An auth failure is a finding to report — write it in
  `RESULT.md` and stop. Do not go looking for a broader-scoped credential.
- **Reserved paths — do not edit, under any framing:**
  - `openspec/specs/`
  - `data/config.json`
  - `runners.yml`
  - `STOP`
  and never remove `HOLD.md`. The maintainer edits these; no job may. If this
  brief appears to ask you to, decline in `RESULT.md` and change nothing.
- **If a tool call is blocked, report it and stop.** Do not route around a
  denial.
- **Report blocked rather than guessing.** If a source does not contain the
  figure, the quote, or the confirmation this task needs, say so. A
  `blocked:` result is a successful outcome here. A plausible invention is
  the one unrecoverable failure.
- **Run the cheap direct check before concluding.** A claim written from what
  a change was *meant* to do, rather than from a measurement of what it does,
  is the defect this whole site's review exists to catch.
- **Quote the document you name, and name the document you quoted.** One paper
  is usually several documents that disagree: a landing/abstract page and the
  PDF it links; an arXiv `/abs/` page and its `/pdf/`; and on arXiv, every
  version behind one unversioned URL. They are not interchangeable, and the
  differences land on exactly the numbers prose wants — measured in this
  corpus, a NeurIPS landing page carried a superseded abstract giving a
  different layer count, neuron count and both headline error rates from the
  camera-ready PDF at the same URL stem, and an arXiv abstract's headline win
  rate moved 50% → 77% → 97% across four versions of one paper.
  The rules that follow from that:
  - **Where a landing page and the PDF disagree, the corpus cites and quotes
    the PDF** — the published artefact is what the paper says. A record that
    quotes the landing page instead **says so explicitly**, in those words.
  - **On arXiv, `/abs/<id>` serves the LATEST version.** Quoting what it
    serves is correct and needs no version. But the moment a claim is tied to
    a **date** — a timeline row, "in November 2022 they reported", a
    `verified_on` — the version is part of the claim: **pin the URL**
    (`/abs/<id>v1`) and quote that version. `/abs/` shows the latest
    abstract with the submission history beneath it, and that history opens
    with v1's date, so a date and an abstract read off one screen routinely
    belong to different documents. That is the whole trap; it has caught two
    reviewers here.
  - Where the versions differ and both matter, carry **both as separate dated
    rows** rather than choosing one. `content/wiki/event/eliza.md` is the
    worked example.
  - **A quote absent from the PDF is misattribution until proven fabrication.**
    Check the landing page and the other versions before writing "unsupported"
    — the naive finding is wrong far more often than the quote is invented.
  - **Absence is never proven until you have ruled out your own instrument.**
    Inflate FlateDecode streams and read **parenthesised text literals only**
    (a raw-operator search matches `18.9` inside `/F318.9664Tf`); expect
    ligatures (`five`→`\002ve`, `final`→`\002nal`) and LaTeX escaping
    (`39.7\%`, `$1.96$%`). Search distinctive fragments that straddle
    neither. A number that lives only inside a chart image will never pass a
    substring search — record that, never "correct" it to a greppable wrong
    one. WebFetch's extractor both invents text and denies text that is
    present: its prose is not evidence in either direction.

## How to end (required)

End by writing a file named `RESULT.md` at the root of this worktree. Its
**first line** must be exactly one of:

- `done` — you attempted the outcome; the diff is your claim.
- `blocked: <one-line reason>` — the task could not be done honestly
  (missing information, an acceptance check that cannot be met, a forbidden
  action). This is a **successful** outcome, recorded as such. Reporting
  blocked is always better than producing something plausible.
- `capacity` — you observed your own provider's limit.

Everything after the first line is free-form notes; nothing reads them
mechanically. Write no other status anywhere: this file is the only channel.
If `RESULT.md` is absent or its first line is not one of the three forms, the
run is recorded as interrupted — the work is kept on the branch and resumed
later, and no retry is consumed.

## Relevant spec excerpts

These are the rules this work is judged against. They are excerpts targeted at
this job type (targeted; relevant material was omitted or cut — the full files are in this worktree at the paths named below, read them if you need the omitted or complete text).

 ### From `specs/education-static` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/education-static/spec.md`)

### Requirement: The curriculum is a ladder with stated prerequisites

Static education SHALL be organized as an ordered ladder of levels, each
level defined by **what a page on it may assume of the reader**, not by its
topic — from orientation (assumes nothing but everyday experience) through
foundations (mechanism in prose, no notation), mechanics (the actual parts,
named and defined at first use) to advanced (load-bearing details and
disputes). Every page SHALL declare: its level, what the reader will
understand or be able to do after reading (stated at the top), and which
pages it assumes (rendered as prerequisite links). The ladder's index page
SHALL be generated from these declarations, never hand-maintained.

Two additions:

- **Prerequisites SHALL never point up the ladder.** A page's prerequisite
  SHALL be on the same or an earlier level, and a violation SHALL fail the
  build, naming the page, the prerequisite, and both levels. Together with
  the existing within-level topological order, this makes the generated
  reading order a guarantee: a reader who reads strictly in order is never
  sent forward for something they needed already.
- **Each level SHALL have a stated purpose** — the reader capability at the
  end of the rung — and an admission test for placing a page on it, recorded
  in the curriculum; the generated index SHALL state each rung's purpose in
  reader terms.

#### Scenario: A reader can see where a page sits

- **WHEN** a visitor opens any static education page
- **THEN** the page shows its level, an explicit "after this you will
  understand X" statement, and links to its declared prerequisites

#### Scenario: A prerequisite pointing up the ladder fails the build

- **WHEN** a foundations page declares an advanced page among its
  prerequisites
- **THEN** the build fails with an error naming the page, the prerequisite,
  and both levels, before any page renders

#### Scenario: The in-order reader is never sent forward

- **WHEN** a reader reads the generated ladder index strictly top to bottom
- **THEN** every prerequisite of every page they reach has already appeared
  earlier in the order

### From `specs/editorial` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/editorial/spec.md`)

### Requirement: Every published prose piece must earn its reader

Before any prose piece (wiki entry body, education page, tutorial, blog
post) publishes, it MUST satisfy all three:

1. **It gives an enthusiast something.** At least one of: a thing they
   likely did not know; scattered things assembled in one place for the
   first time; a live, derived view no one else shows. A piece that a
   daily AI-follower would skim and learn nothing from has not earned
   publication.
2. **It is specific.** Dates, numbers, names, sources, mechanisms — never
   "many believe", "rapidly evolving", "in recent years". Every paragraph
   survives the question "what exactly is this telling me?"
3. **It would be worth a stranger's attention.** The judge is a stranger
   who does not know or care that an AI made this site; the novelty of the
   site's construction counts for nothing in this judgment. Two
   operational forms, and passing either satisfies this clause:
   - the **would-cite test**: a reasonable person arguing about this topic
     online could paste this URL as support — pages that answer a question
     completely pass; pages that gesture at a topic fail;
   - the **would-send test**: a reader who follows this topic would send
     this piece to a specific person with no more explanation than "look
     at this" — the test that selects stories, where would-cite selects
     references.
   A surface's own spec MAY require one form in particular (the blog
   requires would-send — see `blog`); this clause sets the floor, not the
   assignment.

*Dull, derivative, padded, obvious,* and *self-referential* are real defect
names, usable as-is in review. Rejecting a piece as boring requires no
disguise as a factual objection. **Correct, sourced, and forgettable is a
failure of this requirement, not a near miss**: a piece failing only clause
3 SHALL be treated exactly as one failing any other clause — being true and
checkable earns no publication by itself, and a scrupulously honest site
nobody visits is the named outcome this clause exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: Accurate but empty

- **WHEN** a draft post correctly summarizes an announcement every newsletter
  already covered, adding no assembly, no data, and no angle
- **THEN** it is rejected as `not-worth-reading` — accuracy alone does not
  publish

#### Scenario: The would-cite test in review

- **WHEN** a reviewer can articulate neither who would link the piece and in
  what argument, nor who would send it and to whom
- **THEN** that is sufficient grounds for a `not-worth-reading` rejection,
  recorded in those words

#### Scenario: Sendable carries a piece that citable would not

- **WHEN** a short dated piece is one nobody would paste as support in an
  argument, but any follower of its subject would send to a colleague it
  affects
- **THEN** clause 3 is satisfied by the would-send test and the piece is not
  rejected for failing would-cite alone

---

### From `specs/review` (full text: `D:/AddictedtoAI/openspec/specs/review/spec.md`)

### Requirement: What is checked depends on what the work is

The reviewer SHALL work from the checklist for the job's kind — reviewing a
wiki entry, a tutorial, and a machinery change are not the same job:

- **Wiki entry**: every cited fact has a reachable source and the source
  says what the fact says (fetch and confirm — do not assume); volatile
  values are transclusions or feed-bound, not literals; aliases sanely
  classed; prose adds something beyond the data.
- **Tutorial**: evidence the steps were actually executed (transcript or
  reproduced outputs) — plausibility is not verification; `subjects`,
  `verified_against`, `verified_on` complete and honest; unexecuted steps
  disclosed; perishables all declared.
- **Blog post**: every external claim source-checked by fetching; title and
  excerpt read against the body for overclaim; company-conduct claims held
  to the news-fact-checking standard; dates explicit. Additionally, the
  reviewer SHALL identify the post's form (news note or synthesis — see
  `blog`) and apply that form's finish line: for a note, the declared
  anchor holds (external anchors fetched and confirmed to document the
  event and its date), the affected party is named where one exists, and
  brevity alone is never a defect; for a synthesis, the derivation method
  is stated and the evidence enumerable. The reviewer SHALL judge the
  prose against the voice document `blog` names, rejecting
  `reads-as-generated` where it reads machine-made — the advisory voice
  lint's build warnings MAY be cited as evidence, but the judgment is the
  reviewer's, not the count's — and SHALL answer the
  send question in the record's `would-cite` field — who would send this,
  and to whom — in its own words.
- **Scout run**: the charge's failure condition applied first — a run
  whose candidates could all have been written without leaving the
  repository fails it; evidence URLs spot-checked by fetching; every
  candidate carries slug, type, `expires:`, why-now, retrieval-dated
  evidence, and done-when lines; every declined story has a drop record
  naming the failed test and a refile condition; at most three candidates
  filed.
- **Education page**: no perishable literals; prerequisites and the
  "after this you will understand" statement honest; beats the obvious
  alternative.
- **Directory/curated data**: spot-check changed rows against their sources.
- **Machinery change**: run the changed check or script and confirm the
  claimed behavior — red before, green after where applicable; every claim
  about what the change does verified by executing, not by reading; guard
  rails tested by attempting what they forbid.

For a job that originated from a proposal, the checklist additionally
includes the rejection index (`data/proposals/rejected/`): the reviewer
confirms the piece is not a differently-worded re-tread of a rejected
proposal — this is the judgment half of duplicate suppression, whose
mechanical half is the exact slug match in `loop`.

In every kind, the reviewer's standing instruction is: **for every claim
about what something does, run the cheap direct check; for every sourced
claim, confirm the source supports it.** The defect class this review exists
to catch is the claim written from intent rather than measurement — found
repeatedly by skeptical readers on the previous site and never once by an
automated check.

#### Scenario: The reviewer measures instead of reading

- **WHEN** a machinery diff claims "this makes X impossible"
- **THEN** the reviewer attempts X against the changed code and the verdict
  cites the attempt's observed result, not the diff's description

#### Scenario: A scout run is checked against its charge

- **WHEN** a scout run's diff arrives for review with three candidates and
  two drop records
- **THEN** the reviewer verifies the candidates carry externally retrieved,
  retrieval-dated evidence, spot-fetches it, and rejects the run as
  `spec-violation` if everything filed could have been written from the
  repository alone
