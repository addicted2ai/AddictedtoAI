# Changelog & Loop Log

This file is the loop's memory. Every entry records a hypothesis, what
shipped, and — the following week — whether it actually moved the metric.
The weekly proposal step reads this file before deciding what to try next,
so keep entries short and honest, including the failures.

## North star
Returning-visitor rate (site-wide).

## Section metrics
- Blog: organic search traffic, avg. read time, scroll depth
- Directory: outbound clicks to tools, on-site search usage
- Projects: inquiry/contact clicks, outbound repo clicks, time on page
- Demos: completion rate, repeat-use rate, session length

## Guardrails (never regress these)
- Lighthouse: performance >= 0.80, accessibility / SEO >= 0.85 —
  each asserted against the median of 3 runs (see `lighthouserc.json`).
  Performance's floor was lowered from 0.85 and runs went from 1 to 3
  with median scoring on 2026-08-09 after single-run performance scores
  proved too noisy on shared CI hardware to gate on reliably (the same
  untouched homepage scored 0.83 then 0.74 back to back). Accessibility
  and SEO are static-analysis checks, not timing-based, so they weren't
  the noisy ones and stayed at 0.85.
- Zero net-new broken links
- No failed deploy / rollback

## Log

### Unreleased
- Hypothesis: The site has 7 separate `transition` declarations across
  its cards, buttons, and links, and none of them respected
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Motion sensitivity is a real accessibility
  need (vestibular disorders, among others), and it's the kind of gap
  a static Lighthouse audit doesn't reliably catch — this only shows
  up if you actually check the OS-level preference.
- Change: Added a single global
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule to
  `app/globals.css` that collapses `transition-duration` and
  `animation-duration` to near-zero for every element, rather than
  patching each of the 7 individual transition rules by hand — more
  robust, and it automatically covers any transition/animation added
  later too. (PR #TBD)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; verified
  empirically with Puppeteer's `emulateMediaFeatures`, not just by
  reading the CSS — a `.tool-card`'s computed `transition-duration`
  measured 0.15s under normal conditions and dropped to 0.00001s with
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` emulated)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The site had no web app manifest and no `theme-color`,
  so mobile browser chrome (the address-bar area on Chrome
  Android/Safari iOS) doesn't match the site's dark theme, and there's
  no metadata for "Add to Home Screen" to use. Small, standard PWA-lite
  polish that costs nothing new — reuses the `icon.svg` and colors
  already shipped.
- Change: Added `app/manifest.js` (Next.js's file convention, compiles
  to `/manifest.webmanifest`) with name/short_name/description/
  background_color/theme_color all matching existing site metadata,
  and a single SVG icon entry reusing `/icon.svg`. Added
  `export const viewport = { themeColor: "#0b0d0f" }` to
  `app/layout.js` — `themeColor` lives in a separate `viewport` export
  in this Next.js version, not `metadata` (verified against current
  docs; the older pattern of putting it in `metadata` is deprecated).
  (PR #17)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; manifest
  JSON validated to parse correctly; theme-color meta tag and manifest
  link tag verified present in rendered HTML)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The site had no custom favicon, so browser tabs and
  bookmarks show Next.js's generic default icon instead of anything
  that identifies AddictedtoAI — a small but real polish/identity gap
  for a site that now has real content across every section.
- Change: Original plan was `app/icon.js` using Next's `next/og`
  `ImageResponse` convention (dynamic PNG generation). That broke
  `next build` outright (exit code 1, not just a warning): the
  bundled `next/og`'s default-font loader
  (`fileURLToPath(new URL("./Geist-Regular.ttf", import.meta.url))`)
  threw `TypeError: Invalid URL` in this environment. Tried supplying
  an explicit custom font to avoid that code path, but every candidate
  static-font URL tested came back 404 — not worth guessing at a
  fetch-at-build-time dependency for a favicon, especially one that
  can fail the *entire* build if the URL ever breaks. Went with a
  static `app/icon.svg` instead: no build-time image generation, no
  font dependency, works identically on every platform, and Next.js
  picks it up automatically via the same file-convention mechanism.
  Simple mark: rounded square in the site's accent color (`#5eead4`)
  with a bold "A". Skipped a matching `apple-icon` for this round —
  Apple requires PNG specifically (SVG isn't supported for home-screen
  icons), which would need the same broken `ImageResponse` path or a
  real image asset I don't have; worth a follow-up once there's a
  proper image-generation path. (PR #16)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean, exit code 0; local link
  check with `linkinator` against the production build for all 5
  routes; manually verified `/icon.svg` is served with a 200 and
  correct content, and that `<link rel="icon">` points at it)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: `.nav` had no `flex-wrap`, and the nav has grown to 5
  items ("AddictedtoAI" plus the 4 sections). Measured with Puppeteer
  at a 360px mobile viewport (iPhone SE-class width) before touching
  anything: the nav caused 48px of horizontal overflow
  (`document.body.scrollWidth` 408px vs. `window.innerWidth` 360px) —
  a real, confirmed bug, not a hypothetical one. Horizontal overflow
  on mobile is a concrete usability problem (content gets clipped or
  the whole page gains an awkward horizontal scrollbar) that would
  hurt every metric downstream of a mobile visitor actually being able
  to use the site, most directly the north-star returning-visitor rate
  if their first visit is broken.
- Change: Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to `.nav` in `app/globals.css`
  (plus switched `gap` to a row/column shorthand: `0.75rem 1.5rem`)
  so nav items wrap onto a second line on narrow viewports instead of
  overflowing the page horizontally. Re-measured the same way after
  the fix: `document.body.scrollWidth` now matches `window.innerWidth`
  exactly (360px) at the same viewport. (PR #15)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; the fix
  itself was verified empirically with a Puppeteer before/after
  measurement at a 360px viewport, not just asserted from reading the
  CSS)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: No page declared a canonical URL, and the sitemap
  (shipped a few rounds back) lists routes without a trailing slash
  while Next.js will happily serve the same content whether or not
  one is appended — exactly the kind of ambiguity canonical tags
  exist to resolve. Without one, search engines have to guess which
  URL variant is authoritative for a page, which can dilute ranking
  signal instead of consolidating it on one URL. This completes the
  set of standard technical-SEO levers alongside per-page metadata,
  robots.txt/sitemap.xml, and JSON-LD already shipped.
- Change: Added `metadataBase: new URL(getSiteUrl())` to
  `app/layout.js` (required for relative URLs in `alternates` to
  resolve to absolute ones) and an explicit
  `alternates: { canonical: "<path>" }` to each of the 5 pages'
  existing `metadata` exports. Canonical `alternates` don't inherit
  or auto-derive the way `openGraph`/`twitter` title/description do
  (verified — there's no equivalent fallback mechanism), so each page
  needed its own explicit entry rather than one set at the root.
  (PR #14)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean, no warnings; local link
  check with `linkinator` against the production build for all 5
  routes; manually verified each page's `<link rel="canonical">`
  resolves to that page's own correct path)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The site has no structured data, so search engines can
  only guess at what the homepage is (a site) and what the blog post
  is (an article) from unstructured HTML. Schema.org JSON-LD is a
  standard, low-effort way to state that explicitly, which can make a
  page eligible for richer search result presentation (e.g. article
  rich results with a byline/date) — a lever for Blog's organic
  search traffic metric, complementing the per-page metadata,
  robots.txt, and sitemap already shipped. This is real, accurate
  markup (not fabricated): every field mirrors content already live
  on the page.
- Change: Added `WebSite` JSON-LD to `app/layout.js` (site-wide, name/
  url/description matching the existing root metadata) and
  `BlogPosting` JSON-LD to `app/blog/page.js` (headline/description
  matching the page's own metadata, `datePublished` matching the
  visible "Posted 2026-08-09" byline, author/publisher as the
  `AddictedtoAI` organization since there's no individual byline on
  the post). Both render as `<script type="application/ld+json">`
  tags per Next.js's documented pattern. (PR #13)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; both
  JSON-LD blocks verified to parse as valid JSON and appear correctly
  on their respective pages — WebSite site-wide, BlogPosting
  additionally on `/blog`)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Keyboard and screen-reader users had no way to bypass
  the nav and jump straight to page content — every page load forced
  tabbing through 5 nav links first. That's a real accessibility gap,
  and it's exactly the kind of thing the Lighthouse accessibility
  guardrail (>= 0.85) exists to catch, though a static audit doesn't
  always flag missing skip links specifically. This was originally
  going to be Open Graph + Twitter Card metadata, but building it
  surfaced that Next.js's Metadata API auto-generates Twitter Card
  tags from any `openGraph` object with no documented opt-out —
  confirmed empirically, not just from docs — which conflicts with an
  explicit instruction to keep this site free of
  Twitter/social-platform-specific integration. Open Graph was dropped
  entirely rather than ship the auto-generated Twitter tags, and this
  skip-link fix took its place for this round instead.
- Change: Added a "Skip to content" link as the first focusable
  element in `app/layout.js`, visually hidden until keyboard-focused
  (standard accessible pattern: positioned off-screen, slides into
  view on `:focus`). Points at `id="main-content"` on the `<main>`
  element, with `tabIndex={-1}` so focus actually lands there when
  the link is activated, not just a scroll. Added `.skip-link` styles
  to `app/globals.css`. (PR #12)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; manually
  verified the skip link and its target render correctly in the HTML)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The homepage's only path into the blog is a generic
  section card ("Blog" / "AI news and commentary.") — the same
  abstract, category-level pitch every section card uses. It doesn't
  say there's an actual post there, let alone what it's about. A
  specific, concrete teaser naming the real post ("How this site
  builds itself") is a stronger, more curiosity-driven reason to
  click than a generic category label, and gives the homepage a
  second, more compelling path into `/blog` on top of the existing
  card. Should increase clicks from `/` into `/blog` beyond what the
  section card alone gets, supporting session depth toward the
  north-star returning-visitor metric.
- Change: Added a "Latest from the blog" teaser to `app/page.js` below
  the existing section grid, linking to `/blog` with the actual post
  title and a one-line hook. Hardcoded to the current single post
  (there's no post collection/CMS to generalize from yet — revisit
  this if a second post ships). Added `latest-post`/`latest-post-label`/
  `latest-post-link` styles to `app/globals.css`, matching the existing
  `section-card` look. (PR #11)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes — no new
  unique links, just a second homepage path to the already-checked
  `/blog` route)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: A mistyped or broken internal/external link (very
  possible now that there are 24+ outbound links plus five internal
  routes) hit Next's generic default 404 page — a dead end with no
  way back into the site except the browser's back button. That's a
  direct hit against the north-star metric: a visitor who lands on a
  bare error page is much less likely to explore further or return
  than one who lands somewhere that still offers a way in. Replacing
  it with a styled 404 that links back into all four sections (same
  `section-grid`/`section-card` pattern as the homepage) should
  recover some of those sessions instead of losing them outright.
- Change: Added `app/not-found.js` — Next's App Router convention for
  a custom 404 — styled to match the site and listing all four
  sections as recovery links. Extracted the `sections` list out of
  `app/page.js` into `app/lib/sections.js` so the homepage and the
  404 page share one source of truth instead of duplicating the same
  four entries. No new CSS needed; reuses `section-grid`/`section-card`
  as-is. (PR #10)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean — `_not-found` now
  compiles to a lighter custom page instead of Next's default;
  local link check with `linkinator` confirmed all 4 recovery links
  plus every existing route still resolve 200. The 404 test route
  itself correctly reports 404, which is the intended behavior, not a
  broken link, and isn't among the 5 routes CI actually checks)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The site had no `robots.txt` and no `sitemap.xml` —
  nothing explicitly telling search engines every route is crawlable,
  and no single file listing all five routes for a crawler to
  discover them efficiently. This is a standard, low-effort lever for
  organic search traffic (Blog's metric) and general discoverability
  across every section, complementing last round's per-page metadata:
  metadata makes each page's snippet better once it's found; a
  sitemap and robots.txt make pages easier to find in the first
  place.
- Change: Added `app/robots.js` (allows all crawling, points at the
  sitemap) and `app/sitemap.js` (lists all five routes with
  `lastModified`/`changeFrequency`/`priority`), using Next.js's App
  Router file conventions — both compile to static `/robots.txt` and
  `/sitemap.xml` routes. Added `app/lib/site.js` with a small
  `getSiteUrl()` helper shared by both: prefers an explicit
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var if one is ever set, falls back to
  Vercel's auto-injected `VERCEL_URL` (so it's correct on whatever
  domain is actually live, preview or production, with zero config),
  falls back to `localhost:3000` for local dev. (PR #9)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean — both new routes show up
  as static output; local link check with `linkinator` against the
  production build for all 5 main routes plus the two new ones;
  manually verified `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` render correct
  content)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Every route shared one generic `<title>`/description from
  the root layout ("AddictedtoAI" / "AI news, tools, projects, and
  demos.") — search engines saw the same title and snippet for `/`,
  `/blog`, `/directory`, `/projects`, and `/demos` alike. That directly
  works against Blog's own metric, organic search traffic, and every
  other page's discoverability: duplicate titles/descriptions across a
  site are a well-known ranking and click-through weakness, and a
  generic snippet gives a search result nothing distinctive to show.
  Giving each route its own accurate title and description should
  improve how each page shows up in search results and how likely a
  snippet is to earn a click.
- Change: Added a title template (`"%s | AddictedtoAI"`) to the root
  layout, and a real per-page `metadata` export (title + description)
  to all five routes — the homepage uses an absolute title bypassing
  the template. `/directory` and `/demos` are client components, and
  Next.js doesn't allow a `metadata` export from a Client Component,
  so their interactive parts were extracted into
  `app/directory/DirectorySearch.js` and `app/demos/ToolFinder.js`;
  `page.js` for both is now a plain server component that exports
  metadata and renders the extracted client component — the officially
  documented pattern for this exact situation. No behavior changes to
  either interactive feature. (PR #8)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes; manually
  verified each route's rendered `<title>` and meta description are
  unique and correct; confirmed the Directory search input and Demos
  Tool Finder still render and function identically after the
  extraction)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: All four sections now have real content, so this pass
  looks for a metric with nothing measuring it rather than a
  placeholder. Directory's two documented metrics are "outbound
  clicks to tools" (shipped, PR #2) and "on-site search usage" — but
  there has never been any search or filter UI on the page, so that
  second metric has had zero mechanism to register since the Directory
  existed. Adding a simple client-side search box that filters the
  existing tool cards by name/category as you type gives that metric
  something to actually measure for the first time, and should also
  help entries-browsed-per-session as the list grows past a quick
  scan.
- Change: Converted `app/directory/page.js` to a client component
  (`"use client"`) with a search input; filtering happens client-side
  against the existing `toolCategories` data (name + description
  match, case-insensitive), hiding categories with zero matches and
  showing a "no tools match" message when nothing does. No data or
  routing changes. Added `directory-search`/`directory-no-results`
  styles to `app/globals.css`. (PR #7)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes — the
  default empty-query render still statically includes all 12
  existing tool-card links unchanged, so no new link risk)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Projects was the last remaining placeholder section.
  Its metrics (inquiry/contact clicks, outbound repo clicks, time on
  page) all need a real write-up with real actions to click, which a
  one-line placeholder can't produce. The only project this loop can
  write about truthfully, without inventing a portfolio, is
  AddictedtoAI.net itself — same reasoning as the blog post.
  Two details needed a human decision first (asked before building):
  the site's own repo is private, so there's nothing to link for
  "outbound repo clicks" without it 404ing for visitors; and there was
  no contact channel yet for "inquiry clicks." Given the answers (link
  the GitHub profile instead of the repo; use a dedicated
  AddictedtoAI@proton.me address rather than the personal email), a
  real write-up with working outbound actions should move time on
  page and give both click metrics something to register for the
  first time.
- Change: Replaced the Projects placeholder in `app/projects/page.js`
  with a write-up of the site itself — the idea, how the loop
  works (linking to the blog post rather than repeating it), and the
  stack — plus a `project-actions` row with two outbound
  actions: a `mailto:AddictedtoAI@proton.me` link and a link to
  github.com/addicted2ai. Reused the `article` typography added for
  the blog post; added `project-actions`/`project-action` styles to
  `app/globals.css` for the CTA row. (PR #6)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes.
  Confirmed via lychee's own docs that mail-address checking is
  opt-in via `--include-mail`, which `pr-checks.yml` doesn't pass, so
  the mailto link isn't validated by CI at all — also confirmed
  proton.me has valid MX records regardless. GitHub profile link
  verified 200.)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Blog is the last section still showing the placeholder
  note (Projects is too, but picking one at a time). Its metric,
  organic search traffic, needs something indexable and worth reading
  — a one-line placeholder gives search engines and visitors nothing.
  Rather than invent generic "AI news" commentary (stale fast, easy to
  get wrong, not something this loop can responsibly write without a
  human's editorial voice), the more honest and differentiated post is
  a first-person, fully accurate explanation of how this site itself
  gets built: the weekly propose-build-measure loop, the guardrails,
  and what's shipped so far. It's real content this loop can write
  truthfully (it's describing its own documented process), it's a
  genuinely unusual angle for search ("a site that builds itself"),
  and a substantive single post gives Blog's other metrics (avg. read
  time, scroll depth) something to actually measure.
- Change: Replaced the Blog placeholder in `app/blog/page.js` with a
  single real post, "How this site builds itself," covering the loop
  mechanics, the guardrails, and a recap of the three changes shipped
  so far (PR #1-#3). Added minimal typography styles (`post-meta`,
  `article h2/p/ul/li/code/a`) to `app/globals.css` — the site had no
  prose styling yet since every prior page was short fragments or
  cards. First draft linked out to the GitHub repo as "public"; caught
  in the local link check that the repo is actually private (404 for
  an unauthenticated visitor, not just the crawler), so that claim and
  link were removed before opening the PR. (PR #4)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes, including
  the one broken link caught and fixed pre-PR as above)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Demos is the last of the four sections still showing the
  placeholder note — the same dead-end problem that motivated last
  week's Directory change. Its documented metrics (completion rate,
  repeat-use rate, session length) all require something a visitor can
  actually finish and replay, which a static placeholder can never
  produce. Adding one small, fully client-side interactive demo — a
  "Tool Finder" that asks what you're trying to do and recommends real
  tools from the Directory — gives Demos a real completion event
  (reaching a recommendation), a natural replay loop ("try another
  category"), and a second real cross-section link (Demos to
  Directory) reinforcing the session-depth bet from two weeks ago. This
  should move Demos' completion rate and repeat-use rate, and modestly
  add to Directory's outbound-click numbers.
- Change: Extracted the tool data from `app/directory/page.js` into a
  shared `app/lib/tool-categories.js` module (single source of truth so
  Demos and Directory can never recommend different tools). Replaced
  the Demos placeholder with a client component (`"use client"`) quiz:
  pick a category, see two recommended tools plus a link to the full
  category in the Directory, with a "try another category" reset.
  Added matching `finder`/`finder-option`/`finder-result` styles to
  `app/globals.css`. No new external links: the tool-card recommendations
  only render after a click, so they never appear in the static HTML
  the guardrail crawls. (PR #3)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes — the
  Demos page's static HTML has zero new outbound links, only the
  page's own JS chunk, so this change carries none of the external-link
  risk the last two did)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Last week's change sends real clicks from `/` into
  `/directory`, but the Directory page was still a placeholder note —
  visitors who followed that new entry point landed on a dead end with
  nothing to click. The Directory page's own metric (outbound clicks to
  tools) can't move at all without real tools on the page, and a dead
  end right after the homepage funnel undercuts the session-depth gain
  that change was betting on. Replacing the placeholder with a real
  curated list of AI tools, grouped by category, with outbound links,
  should increase outbound clicks to tools and entries browsed per
  session, both leading indicators for returning-visitor rate.
- Change: Replaced the Directory placeholder with 12 real tools across
  4 categories (Chat & Assistants, Coding, Image/Video/Audio, Workflow
  & Data), each an outbound link opened in a new tab
  (`target="_blank"`) so browsing the directory doesn't cost the
  session. Added matching `tool-category`/`tool-grid`/`tool-card` styles
  to `app/globals.css`. (PR #2)
- Guardrails: pass after one round-trip through CI (local `next build`
  clean; all 12 outbound links plus every existing internal link
  verified 200 with a local link check against the production build
  before opening the PR — one candidate, Notion, was dropped locally
  after it came back 403 from bot protection and was swapped for
  Zapier). The actual CI Lychee run then failed on Gemini
  (`gemini.google.com`) with an HTTP/2 protocol error — a known lychee
  quirk on Google-fronted domains that a local link check couldn't
  reproduce (curl and Node-based checkers negotiate HTTP/2 differently
  and don't trip it). Swapped Gemini for You.com and re-pushed.
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The homepage was a placeholder with no real entry points
  into the four sections (nav links only). Visitors landing on `/` had
  no on-page reason to explore more than one section, and session depth
  (sections visited per session) is a leading indicator for the
  north-star metric, returning-visitor rate. Replacing the placeholder
  copy with four clickable section cards (title + one-line value prop)
  should increase clicks from `/` into `/blog`, `/directory`,
  `/projects`, and `/demos`, which should in turn lift returning-visitor
  rate.
- Change: Replaced the placeholder homepage body with a `section-grid`
  of four `section-card` links (one per section, matching the metrics
  already documented per-section), styled to match the existing dark
  theme. (PR #1)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; no new links beyond the
  four existing section routes, all already covered by nav)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured
