# Changelog & Loop Log

This file is the loop's memory. Every entry records a hypothesis, what
shipped, and — the following week — whether it actually moved the metric.
The weekly proposal step reads this file before deciding what to try next,
so keep entries short and honest, including the failures.

## North star
Returning-visitor rate (site-wide).

## Section metrics
- Blog: organic search traffic, avg. read time, scroll depth
- Directory: outbound clicks to tools, on-site search usage
- Projects: inquiry/contact clicks, outbound repo clicks, time on page
- Demos: completion rate, repeat-use rate, session length

## Guardrails (never regress these)
- Lighthouse performance / accessibility / SEO: all >= 0.85
- Zero net-new broken links
- No failed deploy / rollback

### Unreleased
- Hypothesis: Demos is the last of the four sections still showing the
  placeholder note — the same dead-end problem that motivated last
  week's Directory change. Its documented metrics (completion rate,
  repeat-use rate, session length) all require something a visitor can
  actually finish and replay, which a static placeholder can never
  produce. Adding one small, fully client-side interactive demo — a
  "Tool Finder" that asks what you're trying to do and recommends real
  tools from the Directory — gives Demos a real completion event
  (reaching a recommendation), a natural replay loop ("try another
  category"), and a second real cross-section link (Demos to
  Directory) reinforcing the session-depth bet from two weeks ago. This
  should move Demos' completion rate and repeat-use rate, and modestly
  add to Directory's outbound-click numbers.
- Change: Extracted the tool data from `app/directory/page.js` into a
  shared `app/lib/tool-categories.js` module (single source of truth so
  Demos and Directory can never recommend different tools). Replaced
  the Demos placeholder with a client component (`"use client"`) quiz:
  pick a category, see two recommended tools plus a link to the full
  category in the Directory, with a "try another category" reset.
  Added matching `finder`/`finder-option`/`finder-result` styles to
  `app/globals.css`. No new external links: the tool-card recommendations
  only render after a click, so they never appear in the static HTML
  the guardrail crawls. (PR #TBD)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; local link check with
  `linkinator` against the production build for all 5 routes — the
  Demos page's static HTML has zero new outbound links, only the
  page's own JS chunk, so this change carries none of the external-link
  risk the last two did)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: Last week's change sends real clicks from `/` into
  `/directory`, but the Directory page was still a placeholder note —
  visitors who followed that new entry point landed on a dead end with
  nothing to click. The Directory page's own metric (outbound clicks to
  tools) can't move at all without real tools on the page, and a dead
  end right after the homepage funnel undercuts the session-depth gain
  that change was betting on. Replacing the placeholder with a real
  curated list of AI tools, grouped by category, with outbound links,
  should increase outbound clicks to tools and entries browsed per
  session, both leading indicators for returning-visitor rate.
- Change: Replaced the Directory placeholder with 12 real tools across
  4 categories (Chat & Assistants, Coding, Image/Video/Audio, Workflow
  & Data), each an outbound link opened in a new tab
  (`target="_blank"`) so browsing the directory doesn't cost the
  session. Added matching `tool-category`/`tool-grid`/`tool-card` styles
  to `app/globals.css`. (PR #2)
- Guardrails: pass after one round-trip through CI (local `next build`
  clean; all 12 outbound links plus every existing internal link
  verified 200 with a local link check against the production build
  before opening the PR — one candidate, Notion, was dropped locally
  after it came back 403 from bot protection and was swapped for
  Zapier). The actual CI Lychee run then failed on Gemini
  (`gemini.google.com`) with an HTTP/2 protocol error — a known lychee
  quirk on Google-fronted domains that a local link check couldn't
  reproduce (curl and Node-based checkers negotiate HTTP/2 differently
  and don't trip it). Swapped Gemini for You.com and re-pushed.
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured

### 2026-08-09
- Hypothesis: The homepage was a placeholder with no real entry points
  into the four sections (nav links only). Visitors landing on `/` had
  no on-page reason to explore more than one section, and session depth
  (sections visited per session) is a leading indicator for the
  north-star metric, returning-visitor rate. Replacing the placeholder
  copy with four clickable section cards (title + one-line value prop)
  should increase clicks from `/` into `/blog`, `/directory`,
  `/projects`, and `/demos`, which should in turn lift returning-visitor
  rate.
- Change: Replaced the placeholder homepage body with a `section-grid`
  of four `section-card` links (one per section, matching the metrics
  already documented per-section), styled to match the existing dark
  theme. (PR #1)
- Guardrails: pass (local `next build` clean; no new links beyond the
  four existing section routes, all already covered by nav)
- Result (measured the following week): not yet measured
